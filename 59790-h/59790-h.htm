<h2 class="nobreak">PROLOGUE<br />

<small>THE MISER</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE Dresden clock on the mantel struck
twelve in soft, slow, golden notes. As the
gentle echoes died away, Horace Abernethey,
sitting huddled in a morris chair before the
fire of logs, stirred feebly. Presently, he sat
erect, moving clumsily, with the laboriousness
of senility. But there was nothing of the aged
in the glances of his keen, dark eyes, which
shone forth brightly from out the pallid parchment
of his face. His intent gaze darted first
toward the clock, to verify the hour of which
the gong had given warning; it went next to
the closed window on the right of the fireplace,
over which the shades had not been drawn.
The unsheltered panes were spangled with
raindrops, and, as he watched, a new gust beat
its tattoo on the glass. The old man drew
down the tip of his thin, beaklike nose in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
curious movement of disgust, then stroked petulantly
the white cascade of beard that flowed
to his bosom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curse such weather!&#8221; He snarled, in a
voice querulous and shrill with years. He
stood up with sudden alertness, surprising
after his first awkward slowness; a brisk
gesture of the head threw back from his face
the luxuriant white curls of hair. &#8220;But, in
spite of it, I must go again, and so make an
end of the job&mdash;else&mdash;death might take me
unawares.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abernethey glanced aimlessly about the
long, low-ceiled room, now lighted only by the
glow from the fire. After a little, he advanced
to the center, where a concert-grand piano
dominated the scene. In a moment more, he
had lighted the tall lamp that stood at hand.
A sheet of music in manuscript was lying on
the rack. He seized this, and scanned it
eagerly, muttering the while.</p>

<p>&#8220;Curious it should work out so,&#8221; he
exclaimed, at last; &#8220;curious, and infernally
clever, too!&#8221; He seated himself before the
instrument, still holding communion with his
thoughts. &#8220;Yes, it will do&mdash;capitally&mdash;and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
has the spirit of the thing. It chants the
curse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he ceased speaking, the old
man lifted his arms in a quick, graceful movement.
The long, clawlike fingers, supple still,
fell vehemently on the keys, in a clamor of
melancholy music. There was only a single
strain of melody&mdash;that written on the page
before him; but he played it again and again,
as if obsessed by its weird rhythm, played it
blatantly, tenderly, with reluctant slowness,
with masterful swiftness. And, as he went
on and on, he abandoned the simplicity of the
written score. In its stead, he multiplied harmonies,
superimposed innumerable variations.
The musical rapture revealed the decrepit old
man as a virtuoso. The treatment of the
theme showed him to be at once the scholar
and the creature of vivid emotional imagination,
while the physical interpretation of the
dreaming that drove him on displayed a technique
astonishing in one so burdened with
years.</p>

<p>But ever, throughout the wildest extravagances
of his fancy&#8217;s flight, there was no
failure of that first morbid rhythm, of that first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
monotonous melody in minor set on the sheet
before him.</p>

<p>This was the score on which he built the
ordered sequence of his improvisations:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="center">[<a href="music/lake_mystery_music.midi">Listen</a>]</p>


<p>The player ended with a harsh clangor
from the keys, and whirled about on the stool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
to stare intently toward the wall opposite the
fireplace. Now, his pallid face in the glimpse
that showed above the beard, was faintly
flushed from the bodily strain of playing. But
the fire burning in the dark eyes proved that
the emotion within still maintained its vigor
undiminished. Springing up, he drew his tall,
thin form to its full height, and stood thus
motionless for a long minute, gazing fixedly
at the wall before him. Then, again with the
swift movement of the head by which the
white curls were thrown back from his brow,
he strode forward, and came to a stand facing
the naked wainscoting of the wall.</p>

<p>In the long, barren room, devoid of other
ornament, this paneling was of itself sufficient
to command attention. Beyond a few scattered
chairs, a solitary table with its lamp,
the irons of the fireplace, a cabinet for music,
the piano and the high lamp standing beside
it, there was nothing in the place, not even
so much as draperies to mask the ugliness of
the window-shades. Such scarcity of furnishing
was emphasized by the size of the
apartment, which was fifty feet in length and
half as wide. Doubtless, the occupant had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
preferred the space thus free from aught that
might in any wise hamper the resonance of
the music. Be that as it may, the ornateness
of the wainscoting was made conspicuous,
since only the piano offered another interest.
Of black walnut, it ran to a height of at least
seven feet out of the ten that measured the
wall, and, extending around the four sides of
the room, gave to the aspect of the place a
quality of melancholy so extreme as to be
almost funereal&mdash;an effect in no way lessened
on closer observation, since the deep carving
was merely a conventional labyrinth of
scrolls.</p>

<p>The manner in which Abernethey scanned
the wall opposite him was too intent to be
explained by any ordinary concern with woodwork
long familiar. Moreover, his eyes were
glowing fiercely; the talonlike fingers writhed
curiously where they hung at his sides; the
shaggy white brows were drawn low; from
time to time, the tip of the thin nose was
thrust downward in the movement peculiar to
him. It was plain that he was in the grip of
profound feeling, though he stood mute
before a stark space of wall.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>The old man bestirred himself abruptly.
His right arm was raised with swift grace;
the dexterous fingers played for a moment
silently, yet firmly, on the crowded traceries
of the carving. A flurry of wind brought the
rain clattering noisily against the window-panes,
but the musician gave no heed; the
clock rang softly from a single stroke of the
gong, but his ears had no care for the hour.
He was muttering to himself now, brokenly,
despairingly, the while his fingers wandered
over the intricate design of the paneling:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&mdash;mine ... and I must leave it all&mdash;must
leave it all&mdash;soon! Oh, so soon! God!
The torture of it ... mine&mdash;all mine! Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Without warning sound the panel on which
his hand rested had swung outward, until it
stood like a door, wide-open. An ejaculation
of eagerness burst from Abernethey&#8217;s lips, as
he peered within the opening thus revealed
through the wall. A large plate of polished
steel glimmered in the dim light that came
from the lamp beside the piano. A figured
knob in the center of this plate proclaimed
the fact that here was a cunningly contrived
safety-vault.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>The old man&#8217;s arm again reached forth
with that astonishing quickness which characterized
his every movement. Now, the
agile fingers seized the knob of the safe door,
twirling it with practised certainty of touch.
Presently, the methodical adjustment complete,
he tugged briskly on the knob, and the
door swung outward. An exclamation of
delight burst from Abernethey&#8217;s lips; his form
grew suddenly tense. With febrile haste, he
put both hands to the lighter inner doors, and
pulled them open. A small electric torch lay
ready to hand just within, on which he seized.
Immediately, its soft radiance revealed the
whole interior of the recess.</p>

<p>The space was well filled with canvas bags,
of the sort commonly used to contain specie.
Their appearance there, thus hidden and protected,
left no doubt of the fact that they
were the old man&#8217;s chief treasure. For that
matter, there was nothing else inside the
vault, not even ledgers, or papers of any sort
whatever. It was quite evident that Abernethey
had no hesitation in trusting his other
valuables to less-secret places of security.
Here, he concealed with such elaborate precaution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
only actual coin. And now, secure
from all observation at midnight in this
remote region, where the isolation of time and
place were intensified by the downpour of the
tempest, the aged musician gave free rein to
his consuming passion, stripped from his
nature the last mask of hypocrisy, gloated and
adored at beck of that devil who was his
master.</p>

<p>Abernethey nimbly caught up two of the
bags, and bore them to the table that stood
against the wall to the right of the vault,
where he set them down with a softness of
movement which was like a caress in its tenderness.
Then, he sank into a chair beside
the table, and began untying the cord that
held shut the mouth of one of the bags. It
was only a matter of seconds until the sack
gaped open&mdash;he paused now, to stare about
the room with furtive, fearful eyes. His
scrutiny was directed principally toward the
windows: his lips were drawn in a snarl as he
realized that the shades had not been pulled
down. He sprang to his feet, and darted to
the nearest, where he arranged the shade to
his satisfaction, mumbling and mouthing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
while. Afterward, he made a round of the
room, very swiftly, yet using all care to
render himself secure from observation by
anyone without. A glance at the doors having
shown him that all these were shut fast,
he at last strode back to the table, where the
money-bags awaited him. The chair was
drawn close; into it, Abernethey sagged heavily,
as if in sudden relaxation from the taut
energy that had urged him on hitherto. For
a half-minute, he sat crouched over the table
in an attitude of utter weariness, almost of
collapse. But abruptly, he aroused himself
from the clutch of lethargy. Once again, he
held himself upright; again, his eyes searched
the room craftily, alight with emotional fires.
Finally, his arms rose swiftly, swooped forward
and downward, until the talonlike fingers
closed on the bags, which he drew tight
to his breast where it pressed against the
table. In this posture, which was like an
embrace, he remained moment after moment,
tense, alert, movelessly alive in every fibre of
him. Then, putting term to the rapturous
pause the old man sighed faintly, as one who,
with infinite reluctance, awakes from ecstasy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
He sat rigid, and pushed the two bags a slight
distance from the edge of the table. For
another little interval, he stared at them, half-doubtfully,
in the manner of one returning
slowly to reality after the illusions of a
dream. A second sigh was breathed from his
lips, not blissful now, but weighted with bleak
despair. Presently, he tossed his head impatiently,
and began fumbling with the string of
the second bag. This yielded speedily, as had
that of the first. In another instant, he had
poured forth the contents of the two sacks;
on the table before him lay twin heaps of
gold.</p>

<p>Afterward, for more than an hour, the
miser gave full play to his vice. Before the
smoldering fires of the metal, he worshiped
devoutly, abjectly. His soul prostrated itself
in adoration beneath the golden glory that
he so loved and reverenced. At times, he
plunged his fingers within the heaps, listening
raptly to the clinking song of the coins as
they were moved haphazard by the contact;
at times, he sat dumb, crooning softly, as if
these bits of metal had been sentient things
to hark to his hymn of praise. Other vagaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
were his, innumerable follies, nameless
abasements before this, his most sacred
shrine.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, Abernethey sprang to his feet.
Leaving the glittering piles on the table, he
hurried to the piano, where he seated himself
with face turned toward the altar of his worship.
The supple fingers touched the keys
anew; the melancholy air which he had played
before sounded once again. But now, it was
rendered simply, without extremes of emotion
on the part of its interpreter, without variations
in its harmonic forms. Instead, the old
man played it slowly and gently throughout,
repeating it monotonously many times. The
morbid rhythm stood forth ghastly in its naked,
sordid truth. It came as a hopeless confession
of despair, the ultimate fact in the vice that
was his master.</p>

<p>Abernethey went back to the table, stacked
coins until he had the measure of a bagful,
and thus divided the gold, which was then
returned to the sacks. Next, he brought forth
other bags from the vault, until the table was
covered. This done, he went out of the room,
to reappear after a minute, wearing an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
soft hat and a rain-coat with capacious pockets,
in which he stored, one by one, the bags of
gold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more trips will do it,&#8221; he muttered to
himself, as he turned to close and lock the
vault. &#8220;I must dictate that letter tonight.&#8221;
Under the touch of his hand, the section of
wainscoting swung back into its place. There
was not even the suggestion of a crevice to
hint of the hiding-place behind the carved
wood; the miser turned, and went hastily
from the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Dresden clock on the mantel had just
sounded the hour of four with its golden notes
when Abernethey reentered. The water ran
in a stream from his hat; all around him on
the floor, as he came to a stand inside the
door, drops from the rain-coat formed a
growing pool. With a gesture of weariness,
he cast off the hat, then freed himself from
the coat, which he threw down on the floor
with a carelessness which of itself was sufficient
evidence that the treasure of gold was
no longer there. He went forward to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fireplace, where he sank down into the morris
chair, huddling without movement, as one
exhausted. It was half an hour before he
had rested enough for further exertion.
Then, clumsily and with many groans, he
stood up, and once more left the room. He
returned soon with a phonograph and a box
of rolls, which he set on the table. After he
had arranged the machine, he began to dictate
a letter into the receiver. His words came
distinctly, swiftly, without ever any trace of
hesitation. As soon as the first roll had been
filled with the record, he paused to insert
another, and then straightway continued with
similar precision. When, at last, the miser
made an end, he had used many rolls, and the
first gleam of dawn was beating weakly on
the drawn shades of the room.</p>

<small>ADVENTURERS&#8217; PACT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SAXE TEMPLE regarded with pardonable
pride the supper-table laid for four
in the parlor of his bachelor apartment. Then,
as a knock made known the first arrival, he
went to the door, and opened it eagerly. At
sight of the tall, soldier-like figure standing on
the threshold, his face lighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy Morton, by all that&#8217;s good!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello Saxe, old man,&#8221; came the answer, in
a musical monotone surprisingly gentle from
one so stalwart. &#8220;Got your letter, and here I
am. Incidentally, I&#8217;m tickled to death over the
idea of some real excitement. I haven&#8217;t had any
since a jolly fight in Mexico with a detective,
who thought I was an absconder from the
States, and tried to hustle me across the
border.&#8221; Morton thrust out a rather heavy
chin, so that in a twinkling his face grew
threatening, savage; his kindly blue eyes paled,
the lids drew closer. &#8220;I had colored souvenirs
of his earnestness scattered all over my anatomy
for a fortnight. But I didn&#8217;t have to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a doctor to patch me up, and he did, so I was
satisfied. In fact, I got the doctor for him as
soon as he apologized for his mistake.&#8221; Morton
chuckled at the memory. His face was
again all amiability.</p>

<p>Saxe laughed. &#8220;You still wear a chip on
your shoulder in order to entice somebody into
a scrap,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; Morton exclaimed, huffily.
&#8220;You ought to know that I don&#8217;t want anything
violent. I always try to steer clear of
trouble. It&#8217;s only when something comes up
that a man must resent for the sake of his
self-respect that I ever resort to brute force.
Why, I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe ruthlessly interrupted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly, you&#8217;re a man of peace, all
right! Only&mdash;ah, here&#8217;s one of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe sprang to his feet, and hurried to the
door, on which an imperative knocking
sounded. As he turned the knob, the newcomer
pushed his way into the room unceremoniously,
a man as tall as Morton, but whose
six feet of height bulked much larger by reason
of the massive build and large head, thatched
shaggily with thick, iron-gray hair. The face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
showed rugged ugliness, emphasized by muddy
skin. His voice was wheezy from climbing the
stairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, and what&#8217;s it all about? What and
why? Filibustering? Abduction? Sunken
treasure? Count me in on the scheming, strategy,
conspiring, plotting. But leave me out
when it comes to donning the diving-suit, or
engaging in the merry sword-play at the head
of the stairs, or any aviation. Well, well, it&#8217;s
like old times to be together.&#8221; He had shaken
hands with the two men while speaking,
serenely disregarding their verbal greetings,
for his huge voice boomed over theirs. &#8220;No cigarette,&#8221;
he concluded, waving away the offered
box, as he sank down beside Morton on the
couch. &#8220;I prefer a man&#8217;s smoke.&#8221; He drew
forth, prepared and lighted an especially fat
and black cigar. &#8220;The doctor says I smoke
too much,&#8221; he added, comfortably, after inhaling
a startling volume of the smoke.</p>

<p>Saxe smiled unsympathetically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s eating so much and taking no exercise
that makes you puffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I only eat enough to keep this absurdly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
large carcass of mine properly stoked,&#8221; he
declared. &#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t take violent
exercise. I want my strength for brain-work.
You can&#8217;t use the same vital force in two ways.
If I wanted to be intellectually foolish like you
and Roy, why, I&#8217;d consume my energy in keeping
hard as nails. I, however, prefer intelligence
to biceps&mdash;where&#8217;s Dave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; Saxe exclaimed, as a
knock again sounded.</p>

<p>A moment later, David Thwing, the third
and last guest, was in the room. He was the
only short member of the group, but he was
broad across the shoulders, with a stocky form
that promised unusual strength. He might
have been good-looking, but for the fact that
his nose had once been disastrously smashed
and never rightly repaired. Its present outline
was as choppy as the Channel seas in a gale.
It gave to his face a suggestion of the prize-ring.</p>

<p>Now that the party was complete, Saxe bade
his guests take their places at the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;No explanations till we&#8217;re done with the
meal,&#8221; he announced, in answer to the questions
of his friends.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>It was only when the table had been cleared
of all save decanters and glasses and smoking
materials, that he at last stood up to address
his friends. A certain formality in his manner
arrested their attention, and they regarded him
with a sudden increase of curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s now six years since we left the university,&#8221;
Saxe began. &#8220;In the last year, we
made a boyish pact. We agreed to answer the
call of anyone of us who became embarked in
adventure of a sort to require the assistance
from the others. So I have summoned you in
accordance with the terms of our agreement;
you see, I really have a sort of adventure to
offer you, though perhaps you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m a bit
selfish in the matter, for the profit will be all
mine. Roy, however, has made money enough
so that he doesn&#8217;t need any more, and Billy
always did have more than he could spend,
with his foolish ideas of just learning things,
instead of living them. Dave is reasonably
poor, but, too, he&#8217;s reasonably honest, and so
he&#8217;s better off without the temptations of great
wealth. I&#8217;ve come to the conclusion, after
careful reflection, that I&#8217;m the only one of the
quartette who actually is in want of money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
My tastes are luxurious, and, too, I have ambitious
projects in the direction of operas that I
wish to write. I can&#8217;t give myself to such
serious work while I have to turn all my energies
into musical pot-boilers to soothe the
savage breast of the wolf at the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The metaphor is mixed,&#8221; Billy Walker
grumbled. &#8220;The purpose of pot-boilers is to
soothe the stomach, not the breast. But what
could be expected of a composer essaying
oratory?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe accepted the criticism without rancor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I&#8217;ll let that stand by way of introduction,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;The pith of the matter
is this: I&#8217;ve had some money left to me,
a tidy sum in fact.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instantly, there came a chorus of congratulations
from his friends. But the host waved
his hand for silence, while he shook his head
lugubriously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not exactly ready for congratulations
yet,&#8221; he declared, when they had fallen silent
again. &#8220;It&#8217;s true, I&#8217;ve had some money left to
me, but the deuce of it is, I don&#8217;t know where
the money is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Exclamations burst forth anew, eager questionings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>&#8220;The simplest way of explaining the whole
affair,&#8221; Saxe went on, &#8220;is to make it known to
you in the form in which it was made known to
me:</p>

<p>&#8220;The morning of the day on which I wrote
to you, I received a letter. That letter was
the first warning I had of this possible adventure.
Now, I&#8217;ll read the letter to you, and then
you&#8217;ll have the same knowledge of the whole
matter as I have. By way of preface, I need
only say that the writer of the letter has since
died, and I have been formally notified by his
lawyer concerning the old man&#8217;s will, in exact
accordance with the terms of the letter he
wrote me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man took from his breast-pocket
a typewritten letter, and proceeded to read it
aloud. From the first word to the last, the
auditors sat silent, almost without movement,
save now and then for the relighting of cigar
or cigarette.</p>

<p>The letter ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Saxe Temple, Esq.,<br />

<span class="indent">New York City.</span><br />

Dear Sir:</p>

<p>It will doubtless astonish you at the outset to receive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
a letter of this length from one who is a complete
stranger to you. It will astonish you still more when
you learn the contents of this communication. I shall,
however, set forth the facts in such wise as may enable
you to grasp them understandingly. For your opinion
concerning them or me I care little. I am, in fact,
making use of you as a sort of sop to conscience on
finding myself face to face with death.</p>

<p>All that you need to know is this:</p>

<p>I am a musician. All the love of my life has been
given to music&mdash;with two exceptions, of which I shall
write later on in this letter. As to the music, I have
loved it as an amateur, for I was of independent means
with no need to mix in the sordid struggle for money.
I have never written for production. I have been content
for the most part merely to study, to apprehend
as best I might the work of the masters. What I
have myself composed has been of a wholly desultory
sort, fragments of fragmentary ideas. I have
fashioned now and then the <i>motif</i> of a theme. I have
scientifically worked out by an application of mathematical
laws, based on ratios of vibration, certain
new things in the way of harmony. All these I have
left to you unconditionally. I dare hope and believe
that you will be able to make some use of the material.
If you do so, pray spare yourself the pains of giving
me any credit&mdash;if your honesty be over-nice&mdash;or worrying
your conscience if you chance to be dishonest.
I have no idea that I shall be messing around anywhere
in your environment after I am once dead, and the
world&#8217;s praise can be less than nothing to me after I
have gone from earth. But because you are a musician
and, as I have come to believe, an earnest one, I have
decided to make you heir to my musical legacies certainly&mdash;to
my money perhaps. I&#8217;ll explain the &#8220;perhaps&#8221;
presently.</p>

<p>But first I must tell you of the love that rivaled my
love for music. This was for your mother. On that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
account my thoughts have been directed to you with
special force. On that account this letter to you and
all this letter implies.</p>

<p>Your mother as a girl possessed a wonderful natural
voice and, too, the soul of a musician. It so
chanced that she and I were neighbors and we met
often socially. I was only a few years older than she,
and I was already skilled in music, for I had devoted
myself to the study of it from childhood. I recognized
the supreme worth of her voice at the first hearing.
I fell in love with your mother then&mdash;as a man
with a woman, yes&mdash;even more as a musician in love,
with a glorious instrument of music. It soon became
evident that while she liked me, she could not love
me as a wife should love her husband. I realized the
truth, and though I suffered as an emotional temperament
must suffer in such case, I did not despair. The
musician in me triumphed over the man for I rejoiced
in the glorious gift that she would manifest to the
world. So I merged my passion for the woman in
the enthusiasm of the <i>maestro</i> for his pupil. I offered
myself as her teacher and she accepted me in that
capacity. For two years I taught her. Under my
training, her method became perfect. Her soul, too,
grew, so that she had sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p>Then, just when she was all prepared for her triumph
and my own, she fell in love with your father.
She married him. In spite of all my prayers, my
reproaches, my supplications, she abandoned her
career for love&#8217;s sake. Her husband was opposed to
his wife&#8217;s appearing in public as a singer. She yielded
to his wishes without remonstrance. I believe she
was happy in her way because she loved your father
sincerely, and she counted no sacrifice too great for
love.</p>

<p>You, as a musician, can apprehend perhaps the suffering
I underwent in consequence of this disappointment.
It sickened me of my fellows&mdash;made me a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
recluse. It was in my life of retirement that I developed
my third love&mdash;that of the miser for gold. I
secretly transformed all my possessions into gold,
which I kept in a secret safe here in my house. Oh,
the hours of night during which I have worshiped
before the shining heaps! But enough has been written
at one time and another over the raptures of the
miser, a rapture without justification in reason, yet
more masterful than any other. I shall not weary
you with explanation or excuse. The statement of the
fact alone is sufficient.</p>

<p>Now at last I find myself the victim of a disease
that must end my life course within a few days, perhaps
hours. It becomes necessary then for me to dispose
of my wealth. I am without relations with the
exception of a distant cousin and her daughter, who
are already well-to-do. To this daughter I have left
my house here and the land that goes with it&mdash;a thousand
acres&mdash;which has some value today and will have
more very soon, as the region is being opened up.</p>

<p>For the bulk of my wealth, which as I have said is
in gold, I have selected you as a possible heir, but
you must do your part. I have thus chosen you because
I dare hope that by it you may be helped in
accomplishing something of worth in the art of music
and so atone in some measure for the loss occasioned
by your mother&#8217;s abandonment of her career. The
condition which I have imposed on this legacy is
merely to test you as to your perseverance and your
intelligence. In the event of your failure, half of the
money will go to the girl, and the other half to the
founding of a musicians&#8217; home.</p>

<p>After my death you will be notified by my lawyer,
who has my will duly drawn in accordance with the
conditions I here roughly explain. At once then, you
will come to this place and here conduct a search for
my treasure-chest, which contains three hundred
thousand dollars in gold. If you discover this within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a month from the day of my death, this treasure shall
be yours absolutely. If you fail in the quest the seals
of my description of the hiding-place, which has been
deposited with my lawyer, will be opened and the
treasure secured, to be divided between my young
kinswoman, Margaret West, and the establishing and
endowing of a home for disabled musicians.</p>

<p>Because you are the son of your mother whom I
loved, and because you are a musician of promise, I
have thus chosen you as my possible heir. If you are
as acute as I think, you will easily discover the necessary
clues to the hiding-place of the gold. In the
hunt you have full liberty to use any means you wish,
with the privilege of residing in the house here with
your helpers&mdash;if you employ them&mdash;during the length
of the time allowed you.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gapright">Yours truly,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Horace Abernethey</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>As he finished the reading, Saxe folded
the sheets, and replaced the letter in his
pocket. Then, he sank back into his chair,
and surveyed his friends quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>David Thwing beamed happily through
the heavy lenses of his eyeglasses, as he
spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;And so you want us to go with you, and
of course we will.&#8221; He gazed benignantly
on his fellow guests, then opened his mouth,
and trolled in a musical baritone, &#8220;A hunting
we will go!&#8221; Roy swung into the measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with a nicety of accord in the tenor that
told of old-time practice. Saxe added his
bass, and the song rang out in an harmonious
prophecy of success.</p>

<p>As the refrain ceased, Billy Walker
expressed himself whimsically:</p>

<p>&#8220;This comes as a great relief to me,&#8221; he
explained, grinning cheerfully. &#8220;I&#8217;m all tied
up with commission for erudite essays I&#8217;ve
promised to write. I&#8217;ve been unable to figure
any way in which I could fulfill my obligations.
Now, by cutting the whole thing,
the difficulty will be removed. I shall simply
disappear with you. Saxe, old boy, I thank
you. When do we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, Dave?&#8221; the host questioned
eagerly, though this friend had already given
consent for the three.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t a blessed thing to do,&#8221; was the
contented answer. &#8220;Apart from the pleasant
thrill incident to this questing for hidden
treasure, your wish for my assistance gives
me a new feeling of self-respect, due to the
fact of having something in the nature of
business to attend to. When do we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy Morton nodded amiably, as Saxe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
turned in his direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;When do we
start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re trumps, all of you,&#8221; the host
declared, gratefully. &#8220;I knew I could
depend on you, but to have your assurance
takes a weight off my mind all the same.
I&#8217;d feel infernally helpless, alone on the job.
With you chaps standing by, I know we&#8217;ll
win out. As for starting, well, time is
important&mdash;there&#8217;s a bit less than a month
now left to us. I&#8217;ve looked up trains.
There&#8217;s a good one that starts in the afternoon.
I know it&#8217;s awfully short notice, but,
if you could manage to make it tomorrow,
why&mdash;&#8221; he halted doubtfully, to stare at his
friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tomorrow it is!&#8221; boomed Billy Walker;
and the others echoed agreement.</p>

<small>THE SECRETARY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN THE performance of her secretarial
duties, May Thurston duly drummed on
her machine the remarkable letter to Saxe
Temple, in which the old miser made known
his intended disposition of a golden treasury.
Because she possessed an excellent New
England conscience, the girl maintained
silence, despite the urgings of a feminine
desire to share the secret. This reticence
on her part was the more admirable inasmuch
as, just at this time, her affections
were becoming strongly engaged by a suitor.</p>

<p>Hartley Masters, the man in the case, was
a civil engineer employed in the neighborhood
with a survey for an electric road. On
one occasion, he had stopped at Abernethey&#8217;s
cottage for a glass of water from the well.
The master of the house was absent at the
time, but the secretary was present, and, by
some chance, out of doors that pleasant May
morning. Conventions seemed rather
absurd in that remote region. The young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
engineer admired the charming face and
slender form, and hastened to engage her
in conversation. She responded without
reluctance, rather with pleasure in this diversion
from the monotony of her days. Afterward,
a considerable intimacy developed
between the two. May Thurston had much
of her time free, and Masters contrived so
to arrange his work as to take full advantage
of her leisure. That his heart was touched
seriously may be doubted, but his courtship
lacked nothing in the evidences of intensity
and sincerity. He made a deep impression
on the girl, who was both ingenuous and
tender. Masters was the first to whom she
had given more than the most casual heed,
and, almost at the outset, she found her
affections engaged. She regarded him as
astonishingly handsome&mdash;as, in truth, he
was&mdash;in a melodramatic fashion of his own,
with huge dark eyes, long-lashed and glowing,
a sweep of black mustache, and thick,
clustering hair, which was always artistically
tousled. In fact, the whole appearance of
the man was blatantly artistic, in the bohemian
acceptation of the word, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
scrupulous to wear on all occasions a loose
bow of silk at his throat. He was tall, too,
and broad enough, but there was too much
slope to his shoulders, his neck was too long,
his head bulked too large for harmony. His
voice was agreeable, his manners were
suave, quickened by a jauntiness, which was
perhaps assumed to harmonize with the
insouciant air of the cravat. May Thurston,
who had read her Byron, thought of him as
<i>The Corsair</i>, and her heart fluttered.</p>

<p>It is easily understood that the secretary&#8217;s
keeping silence concerning her employer&#8217;s
remarkable testamentary plans showed her
the possessor of some strength of character,
as well as a sense of honor. She even managed
to keep her own counsel after Masters
openly declared his love, and besought her
to become his wife&mdash;at some vague time in
the future, when he should have arrived at
a position of independence. She yielded
readily to his ardor, and had plighted troth,
all a-tremble with maidenly confusion and
womanly raptures. Then, a few days later,
Abernethey died. She felt now that she was
at liberty to reveal the circumstances of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
will to her lover. As they strolled on the
lake shore, the evening of the day after the
miser&#8217;s death, May told the story, to which
Masters listened with absorbed attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mad as a hatter!&#8221; he ejaculated, contemptuously,
as the girl brought her narrative
to a close. Yet, though his voice was
mocking, there was manifest in his expression
an eagerness that puzzled the girl.</p>

<p>She would not permit his comment to go
unrebuked:</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she declared firmly, &#8220;Mr. Abernethey
was not mad. He was eccentric, of
course&mdash;very! That was all, however. He
wasn&#8217;t crazy&mdash;unless every miser is crazy.
He had a sense of humor, though, and he
didn&#8217;t quite know what to do with his money.
So he finally worked out the scheme I&#8217;ve
told you of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, he really did it as a sort of joke,&#8221;
Masters suggested eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;As much that as anything else,&#8221; May
answered, and her tone was thoughtful.
&#8220;There was sentiment on account of Saxe
Temple&#8217;s mother and the old love-affair.
And, of course, this young man&#8217;s interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
music made it seem like a good disposal of
the money. But I have a suspicion, too, that
Mr. Abernethey really enjoyed hiding the
money&mdash;making it hard for anyone else to
get hold of it, you know. That idea appealed
to his miserly instincts, I think. How he
hated to leave it! &#8216;No pockets in a shroud!&#8217;
I&#8217;ve heard him mutter a hundred times. It
was horrible&mdash;and pitiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, miserliness is an awful vice,&#8221;
Masters agreed. His tone was perfunctory,
although his inflections were energetic
enough.</p>

<p>There fell a little silence between the
lovers. Where they sat on the west shore,
beneath the rampart of wooded hills, it was
already deep dusk, but out on the open space
of water shone a luminous purple light, shot
over with rose and gold, a reflected sunset
glow over the eastern mountains. May
Thurston stared happily at the wide, dancing
path over the water that led to the newly
risen full moon, and she dreamed blissfully
of the glory of life that was soon to come
to her beside the man who had chosen her
as his mate. Masters, on the contrary, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
equally enthusiastic in his musings, was by
no means sentimental, as he gazed unseeingly
across the lake&#8217;s level, now wimpling
daintily at touch of the slow breeze. The
young engineer&#8217;s thoughts were, truth to
tell, of a sort sordid, even avaricious, covetous;
and, at last, after a period of profound
reflection, he uttered his thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;May, dearest,&#8221; he said softly, with a
tender cadence, &#8220;what a shame it is that that
old miser didn&#8217;t think of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl faced her companion with a
movement of shocked surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think of us!&#8221; she repeated, confusedly.
&#8220;Whatever can you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Masters turned, and regarded May with
intentness, a fond smile showing beneath the
curve of his mustache. His voice, as he
spoke now, was softer than usual:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I was just thinking on
the hardness of fate&mdash;sometimes. Here was
this old man, with more money than he knew
what to do with, and here are we without a
penny. There was nothing money could do
for him, except gratify a vice&mdash;the madness
of the miser; and money could do everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
for you and me, sweetheart. The thought
of it made me say it was a shame the old
man didn&#8217;t think of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after all, we couldn&#8217;t expect him
to,&#8221; the girl said placidly, with the sober
sense characteristic of her. &#8220;Of course, it
would have been nice to have his fortune,
but we must be patient, Hartley.&#8221; She
turned her face again to the east, and looked
out into the deeper purples of the distance,
beholding again fair visions of the happiness
to come.</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s tones were somber, as he
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you, May, it seems to me like no
man&#8217;s money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl aroused herself from dreaming,
and for the second time regarded her lover
with puzzled inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, Hartley?&#8221;
she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean,&#8221; came the deliberate answer,
&#8220;that this hidden fortune of Abernethey&#8217;s
doesn&#8217;t really belong to anyone at this
moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; the secretary exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
briskly, confident as to the fact out of her
stores of business experience. &#8220;The money
belongs to the estate. By due course of law,
it will go to Saxe Temple, if he fulfills the
condition under which it has been left him.
If he fails, it will go to the girl and the
musicians&#8217; home.&#8221; She smiled contentedly,
pleasantly conscious of her own erudition,
and looked out over the lake again, watching
idly the frolicing dance of the swallows to
the movement of the waves.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary,&#8221; Masters continued
argumentatively, &#8220;at this very moment, the
ownership of that gold is problematical.
Nobody exactly owns it, although theoretically
the title to it is vested in the surrogate&#8217;s
court, or whatever they call it in this wilderness.
As a matter of strict fact, that gold
has become hidden treasure. To be sure, the
old man has left directions as to who shall
have it if found, and who shall have it if
it&#8217;s not found. But, suppose now, someone
else were to find it&mdash;not Saxe Temple?&#8221;
The girl uttered an ejaculation, and faced
her lover with startled surprise, meeting the
fire of his gaze bewilderedly. &#8220;Suppose I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
were to find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>May Thurston sprang to her feet, and
regarded the speaker with an expression of
sheer amazement, which swiftly changed to
one of dismay. The softly-tinted rose of her
cheeks flamed suddenly to scarlet; her luminous
eyes, usually so gentle, sparkled dangerously.
She stared fixedly at the man for a
few seconds. At first, he encountered her
gaze steadily enough, smiling. But, presently,
under the accusation in her look, the
smile passed from his lips, and his eyes fell.
The girl continued to observe him indignantly
for a few moments more. Then, at
last, she spoke; and now there was more of
sorrow than of anger in her voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartley!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exclamation was a reproach, and as
such the young man recognized it. He rose
quickly, caught May&#8217;s hands in his, and
spoke tenderly in justification of himself, his
eyes again meeting hers boldly.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, Masters showed
a wily patience. He recurred to the subject
of the miser&#8217;s gold again and yet again. The
girl&#8217;s reluctance slowly grew less, as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
found herself unable to combat the ingenuities
of his reasoning. Finally, she reached
a point where she no longer opposed his
wishes, although she still held to her own
conviction as to the wrongfulness of that
which he proposed. The man felt that he
could trust to her neutrality, so reluctantly
conceded. With this for the time being, he
rested content.</p>

<small>THE ASSEMBLING</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE dwelling in the wilderness contained
only two servants, a woman of
fifty, who performed the duties of housekeeper
and cook, and her husband, slightly
older, who did the small amount of outdoor
work required about the cottage, but, during
the open weather, was chiefly concerned
with the care of the two motor boats, which
had been the miser&#8217;s single extravagance.</p>

<p>After the funeral, the lawyer of the
deceased ordered Jake Dustin and his wife
to remain at the cottage for the time being,
to await the outcome of the bequest. May
Thurston, also, was retained as the one person
most conversant with Abernethey&#8217;s
affairs. These arrangements made, the
attorney returned to Boston, holding himself
in readiness for another visit to the cottage
at any time when his presence there
might be required in connection with the
inheritance. Masters, naturally enough,
rejoiced in the situation thus created, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
left him entire freedom in the prosecution of
his illicit search for the treasure. He
realized to the full that his best opportunity
would be limited to the short interval before
the arrival on the scene of others, who would
inevitably regard his presence with surprise,
if not with actual suspicion. For the
moment, however, there was none to offer
any hindrance. Jake was engaged in overhauling
his engines within the boat-house,
which was situated a full hundred yards
from the cottage; he had neither eyes nor
ears for the actions of Hartley Masters who,
in his opinion, was merely &#8220;sparkin&#8217; that
Thurston gal mighty clus.&#8221; Mrs. Dustin,
for her part, was absorbed, as always, in a
relentless warfare against matter out of
place, which she consistently loathed as dirt.
As she invariably talked aloud to herself, she
gave ample warning of her whereabouts at
all times, and it was no difficult thing to
evade her.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the advantages of his situation,
Masters, to his chagrin, learned nothing
concerning the treasure.</p>

<p>The young man&#8217;s failure was pleasing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
rather than otherwise, to May Thurston,
who, at intervals, kept alongside him in the
quest, though always without affording him
other assistance than the doubtful comfort
of her presence. Despite the fact that his
specious arguments had silenced her, she
was by no means convinced as to the propriety
of his undertaking. Her conscience
still spoke clearly, even while she abandoned
controversy with Masters for love&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>A telegram from Mrs. West came to May,
in which it was announced that the widow
and her daughter, Margaret, would arrive
at the lake on the day following. The lawyer
had advised Mrs. West concerning the
death of Abernethey and her daughter&#8217;s
inheritance of this property, together with
the possibility of another fortune, should
Saxe Temple fail in his search for the
secreted hoard of gold. On receiving the
telegram, May was in a flutter of pleasureable
excitement. Notwithstanding her
devotion to Masters, the isolation of this life
in the wilderness was a weariness to her
spirit, and she joyously looked forward to
the coming of the heiress, a girl presumably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of about her own age, who might afford her
that companionship she so craved.</p>

<p>Masters, on the other hand, was filled with
an impotent rage against the promptitude of
Mrs. West&#8217;s answer to the announcement
of Abernethey&#8217;s death.</p>

<p>&#8220;The vultures flock to feed on the carcass,&#8221;
the engineer sneered, with an angry tug at
the flowing length of his mustache.</p>

<p>May&#8217;s lips set primly, as she stared at the
handsome face of her lover with rather less
than her usual admiration for his romantic
air. It occurred to her active intelligence that
Hartley was hardly the one to scorn those
who came lawfully to claim their own, while
he was unlawfully seeking the property of
another with such feverish eagerness. But,
with feminine wisdom, she held her peace,
while Masters went on fuming futilely
against fate. With the aid of time-tables,
she calculated the exact hour at which Mrs.
West&#8217;s arrival might be expected, since the
message had neglected to state this, and
then sought Jake, to whom she gave instructions
that he should go down the lake in one
of the motor-boats the next morning to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the ten o&#8217;clock train, north-bound, at the
station three miles away. When, that night,
Masters, still grumbling, kissed her good
night, her lips were passive, which had not
been their wont.</p>

<p>Masters reappeared early the next morning,
for he was aware that in a few hours
his best opportunity to search would be past.
He utterly ignored the fact that his engineering
work was being neglected to an extent
that must soon involve him in serious trouble
with his employers. The possibility of
wealth had suddenly come to dominate his
thoughts, and it allowed no rivalry. He was
pale, as if after a sleepless night, and his
thatch of hair was tangled in a confusion
real for once, not contrived with studied
pains. His great, black eyes were glowing,
as he encountered May at the cottage door.
The girl sighed as she noted the haggard
appearance of his face and the tenseness of
his movements, usually so briskly graceful.
A certain latent fierceness in his expression
caused a thrill of apprehension in her heart.
She was shocked that he could enter thus
whole-souledly into a nefarious project for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the sake of gain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the old woman?&#8221; Masters questioned
curtly, after a scant phrase of greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the kitchen,&#8221; May answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must hurry,&#8221; the engineer continued,
alertly. &#8220;But, anyhow, I have almost four
hours clear. They can&#8217;t get here before
eleven, I guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If the train&#8217;s on time, they should get
here about half-past ten,&#8221; May corrected.
There was a note of warning in her voice.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let them find you&mdash;&#8221; she broke off,
ashamed to finish her thought aloud.</p>

<p>Masters laughed shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear! I&#8217;ll watch out; but hold them
back as much as you can,&#8221; he bade her.
Without more ado, he entered the house.</p>

<p>She heard him go quickly into the music-room,
shutting the door behind him. For
a moment, she rested motionless, irresolute,
her face troubled. Then, with a gesture of
annoyance, she turned away, and went
toward the waiting launch.</p>

<p>The north-bound train arrived hardly a
minute behind its schedule. May, waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
eagerly on the station platform, scrutinized
the few passengers as they clambered down
from the day-coaches. Then, her attention
was caught by the activities of a colored
porter at the vestibule steps of the Pullman.
Beside him, on the cinder path, were three
valises of heavy leather, somewhat battered,
but of undeniable dignity. As the man
adjusted the portable step beside the track,
two women appeared above him on the platform
of the car. May had no doubt as to
their identity. She noted the simple elegance
of Mrs. West&#8217;s traveling suit, the
modish air of the daughter&#8217;s. She observed,
too, the radiant loveliness of the girl&#8217;s face.
A subtle premonition of sorrow obsessed her,
as she stared half-resentfully at the beauty
of Margaret West, elusively revealed from
within a mesh of gray veil. She fought
against the mood, and went forward to greet
the strangers.</p>

<p>The manner of the two travelers was so
cordial that the secretary quickly forgot her
presentiment. Mrs. West proved to be a
handsome, though rather delicate, woman,
of perhaps fifty years&mdash;in voice and manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and in nature as well, a true gentlewoman
of a type now somewhat out of fashion. As
May had already learned from her late
employer, this lady had, throughout her life,
enjoyed ample means, though not great
wealth. The daughter, Margaret, resembled
the mother, but in her slender form was the
grace of youth.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s still a real wilderness
hereabouts,&#8221; Margaret declared,
after the first greetings had been exchanged.
&#8220;I thought it might have changed, since our
visit ten years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s still all wilderness for the way
we have yet to go in the motor-boat,&#8221; May
answered, smiling. &#8220;Here is Jake&mdash;Mr.
Dustin, you know. He&#8217;ll carry your valises
to the landing.&#8221; She indicated the embarrassed
boatman, who was hovering doubtfully
near. With attention thus thrust upon
him, he grinned sheepishly, then turned to
the luggage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chris will help him,&#8221; Mrs. West said.</p>

<p>May looked in the direction of the
speaker&#8217;s nod, and started in astonishment.
In her absorption with the two women, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
had observed neither the coming nor the
presence of this man. Now, she regarded
him curiously. Evidently, from his appearance,
as well as from Mrs. West&#8217;s words, he
was a servant, and May guessed that he
must be as well an old and highly esteemed
family retainer, since he thus made one of the
party on this trip. He was a short man,
rather absurdly fat, though not in the least
heavy of movement, or wheezy of breath. But
he had a general roundness, of a sort almost
infantile, incongruous with perfect baldness.
His tiny black eyes twinkled benignantly. A
somewhat suggestive redness of the skin
made the caricature effect of a Bacchic
Cupid. For the rest, he was neatly dressed
in black, and he smiled genially on May, and
touched his hat decorously, at the reference
to himself, with a respectful, &#8220;Yes, Miss.&#8221;
Then, he stooped alertly to the luggage,
seized a bag in either hand, and waited
expectantly for the more sluggish Jake to
point the way.</p>

<p>May had wholly forgotten her first
impression long before the cottage landing
was reached. She found Mrs. West kindly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and interested, while Margaret displayed a
democratic friendliness that was inexpressibly
grateful to the lonely girl. But, at the
last, all her apprehensions came crowding
back. It was at the moment when they
emerged from the boat-house, and started
toward the cottage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, who is that?&#8221; Mrs. West asked,
with a note of curiosity in her voice.</p>

<p>May looked up, to see Hartley Masters,
as he stepped briskly out from the front door
of the house. At sight of the party on the
shore, he halted abruptly, in seeming confusion;
then, after an instant of indecision, he
swung sharply to the right, into a path that
ran along the lake to the south.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Mr. Masters,&#8221; May answered, a
bit falteringly. &#8220;He&#8217;s an engineer at work
near here&mdash;he calls&mdash;sometimes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some stress in the speaker&#8217;s voice caught
the attention of Margaret. She regarded the
troubled face of the secretary intently for
a moment; then, she stared speculatively
after the tall figure of the engineer, as it
passed swiftly into the concealment of the
forest.</p>

<small>EVE OF BATTLE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MASTERS came suddenly on May
Thurston that same afternoon, as she
chanced to be alone on the cottage porch.
When he appeared so swiftly out of the
wood, which was thick behind the house, the
girl realized that he must have been lying
in wait for this opportunity to meet her
unobserved. The stealthiness of the act
revolted her anew, and the disagreeable
impression was in no wise relieved by the
engineer&#8217;s conversation or manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing&mdash;I found nothing at all!&#8221; he
declared, curtly. His large eyes were glowing
with anger. &#8220;I can&#8217;t understand it.&#8221;
His tone was full of rebellion against the
injustice of fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; May began. Her voice was hesitating,
timid.</p>

<p>Masters went on stormily, disregarding
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t give up though&mdash;just because
they&#8217;ve come.&#8221; He nodded toward the cottage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
&#8220;You must introduce me, at once.
Then, get them outside, to look about&mdash;and
I&#8217;ll have another try at the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl was dismayed by his persistence.
She wished to point out the danger of discovery,
but the engineer would listen to no
protests, and, in the end, his inflexible will
beat down her resistance.</p>

<p>So, presently, Masters was duly introduced
to Mrs. West and her daughter. His
manner was now all suavity. He devoted
himself to making a good impression, and in
this he succeeded, for he was in fact usually
attractive to women, though not to men,
who regarded him with latent suspicion, or
open hostility, according to their various
natures. In this instance, his handsome face,
graceful, frank manner and lively chat
diverted and pleased the mother, while the
more susceptible daughter found herself near
to blushing under the earnest regard of a
stranger so romantic of appearance and so
respectfully, yet obviously, an admirer of her
own charms. Indeed, though Masters was
very discreet, his manner somehow caused
the trouble in May&#8217;s heart to swell, for now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
it was leavened with jealousy. Yet, there
was nothing overt, to which she might take
exception. It was, rather, an intuition that
warned her. But, when she again found herself
alone with her lover, she was confronted
with offense in his first words:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must keep our engagement secret
from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though May had had no thought of any
present publicity for her romance, this peremptory
command came with a shock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;What do you
mean, Hartley?&#8221;</p>

<p>Masters became fluently plausible. His
seeming candor disarmed criticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret West is a pretty girl,&#8221; he
explained, smiling, at last, &#8220;and she is evidently
aware of the fact. If she thinks I&#8217;m
dangling, so to speak&mdash;a victim to her
charms&mdash;she and her mother won&#8217;t wonder
any at my hanging around the place a good
deal&mdash;and it&#8217;s Miss West&#8217;s place now, you
know. It wouldn&#8217;t do for me to make myself
too much at home here just as your fianc,
she might be jealous.&#8221;</p>

<p>His smile over this none too delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
pleasantry was so caressing, his voice was
so tender, he was so tall, so stalwart in
picturesque fashion, so good to look on altogether,
that May quite forgot her first
instinct of indignation. After all, doubtless,
he was right.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t let her think you really
serious?&#8221; she stipulated.</p>

<p>Masters&#8217; face instantly grew grave; his
voice took on a dignity almost rebuking.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, little girl,&#8221; he said, gently; &#8220;that
wouldn&#8217;t be fair to you, or to her, or to me.
But we&#8217;ll keep our secret for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>And to this, albeit reluctantly, May consented.
That reluctance must have become
open revolt, could she have known the inner
workings of her lover&#8217;s crafty and unscrupulous
brain. For the fact of the matter was
that the engineer had no sooner set eyes on
Margaret West than new, daring plots began
to shape themselves in his imagination. His
heart thrilled at sight of her; his interest
deepened second by second. He experienced,
indeed, an attraction strange, dominant.
The emotion was the more impressive inasmuch
as it was totally unlike that with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
May Thurston had inspired him. He had
admired the secretary in rather a placid fashion;
he had enjoyed her dainty appearance,
he had been agreeably entertained by her
lively intelligence; most of all, he had
received flattering unction to his vanity from
the ease of his triumph over her heart. The
case of Margaret was radically different.
Even in the first interview with this girl, he
found himself subject to a spell hitherto
unknown in his experience of women. Being
by no means a fool, he guessed that here in
truth was one actually to possess his love.</p>

<p>That realization worked no sort of regeneration
in the moral nature of the man. On
the contrary, since he was essentially selfish,
it served only to spur him on toward bold
speculations as to all possible gains for himself.
Since he knew the terms of the Abernethey
will, a new scheme flashed on him
within five minutes of his introduction to
Margaret. If he should be unable to find
the hidden treasure for himself, he would
strive his utmost to prevent the success of
Saxe Temple in the quest, since failure on
the heir&#8217;s part would mean Margaret&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
inheritance of one half the gold. By this
means, although he would not secure the
full amount of riches, he would at least
become possessor of a moiety&mdash;for he would
marry Margaret West. He felt no pang of
regret for May Thurston, whom he planned
to betray so basely. His sole concern was
for his own advantage: the securing of the
woman and the money that he desired
fiercely. That he would succeed in this preposterous
ambition, he did not doubt for a
moment, confident of the favor with which
the softer sex usually regarded him. He
took the first step in his conscienceless
scheme when he gazed with respectful admiration
into the eyes of Margaret West; he
took the second when he charged May
Thurston to keep secret the troth he had
plighted her.</p>

<p>On the morning after the coming of Mrs.
West and Margaret, the secretary received
a telegram from Saxe Temple, with the
announcement that he and his friends would
reach the lake that same afternoon. So,
there now remained for the engineer less
than one day of liberty in which to prosecute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the hunt for the treasure. For all his
audacity, Masters knew that he could not
dare to carry on the search during the interval
even, except with utmost caution, lest
he arouse the suspicions of the widow or her
daughter. He had passed most of the time
since their coming in racking his brain with
vain conjectures as to a possible clue, with
the hope of making actual investigation at
a more propitious time. Now, however, the
telegram warned him that his period was at
an end. The presence of the heir and his
associates would effectually halt the
engineer&#8217;s operations, and he realized the
fact with bitterness of spirit. Thereafter,
he must perforce do what he might skulkingly,
ever cautious to avoid any least guess
by anyone as to his purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll keep an eye out,&#8221; he confided to
May, sullenly. &#8220;If they find a hint anywhere,
I&#8217;ll beat them to the goal, after all, you&#8217;ll see!&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank at his words&mdash;something that
was fast coming to be a habit with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Mr. Temple has the right to it, you
know,&#8221; she expostulated, weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he gets it!&#8221; Masters retorted with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
sneer that lifted slightly the luxurious mustache.
&#8220;Only, I&#8217;ll see that he doesn&#8217;t. And,
anyhow, I believe that he must be a pretty
namby-pamby sort of chap. Fancy his bringing
a band of helpers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Abernethey particularly said that he
might do so,&#8221; May reminded her lover.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems a bit cowardly, just the same,&#8221;
Masters maintained. &#8220;I&#8217;ll win out yet. I tell
you, May, the fellow is handicapped: he fears
failure.&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Saxe Temple arrived at the foot of the lake
in mid-afternoon, and with him came Roy
Morton, Billy Walker and David Thwing. Jake
was awaiting the incoming train, his weather-beaten
face aglow with anticipation. The
terms of the will having become known to him,
he had developed what might be called a sporting
interest in the issue. After years of monotony,
excitement had jumped into his life.
Therefore, he now advanced toward the four
young men with suit-cases, who had descended
from the Pullman, and bobbed his head energetically,
his clean-shaven face wrinkled in a
smile.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8220;Mr. Temple and party, I ca&#8217;c&#8217;late?&#8221; he
remarked inquiringly, looking from one to
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am Mr. Temple,&#8221; said the heir, with an
answering smile, as he stepped forward. He
indicated his companions with a gesture.
&#8220;These are my friends, come to help me on a
bit of business I have in the neighborhood.
You know about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake beamed joyously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;ve got quite some suspicionings,
as it were,&#8221; he admitted, cautiously. &#8220;I
hope you&#8217;ve left everybody well to hum?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I believe some in the city are complaining,&#8221;
Saxe replied, with apparent seriousness;
&#8220;but the general health is about the average.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jest so!&#8221; Jake showed himself gratified.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll lead ye over to the motor-boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker groaned stertorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;re not there even yet!&#8221; he
exclaimed, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, putty nigh,&#8221; Jake made assurance;
&#8220;only a matter o&#8217; three mile on the lake. We&#8217;ll
git thar in a jiffy, in the <i>Shirtso</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The what?&#8221; Saxe questioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the ornery name old man Abernethey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
give a perfec&#8217;ly good boat,&#8221; Jake
replied, complainingly. &#8220;He said as how it
meant kind o&#8217; lively.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The name must be <i>Scherzo</i>,&#8221; Saxe
explained to the unmusical and bewildered
Billy Walker; &#8220;the motor-boat, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Billy was not appeased. He kept at
Jake&#8217;s side, as the party moved toward the
landing, a furlong to the east from the station,
and expressed his sentiments vehemently,
though not lucidly, so far as the boatman was
concerned.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m given to understand,&#8221; he said severely
to the puzzled Jake, &#8220;that your craft is not
merely a plain, slow-going, safe-and-sane-Fourth
launch, but, on the contrary, one of
those cantankerous, speed-maniacal contraptions
that scoots in diabolical and parabolical
curves, and squirts water all over the passengers.
If so, I think I&#8217;ll walk&mdash;though I&#8217;m not
fond of walking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake seized eagerly on the one intelligible
phrase in Billy Walker&#8217;s bombast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nary squirt!&#8221; he declared, with emphasis.
&#8220;Old man Abernethey, he was ailin&#8217; jest like
you be, and I learned to nuss the <i>Shirtso</i> keerful&mdash;mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
keerful, yes, siree!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others, who had overheard, laughed impudently
at this nave reference to the invalidism
of their friend, whose physical inertia was
equal to his mental energy.</p>

<p>At sight of the motor-boat, Roy Morton
gave critical attention, scanning it with the
supercilious manner of one versed in the mysteries,
as, indeed, he was. Unbidden, he
ensconced himself at the engines, in the seat
with Jake. Soon, however, his coldly inquiring
expression softened to radiant satisfaction, as
he noted the smoothness of the start, the delicate
adjustment from speed to speed, the
rhythm of the perfectly tuned cylinders. Of a
sudden, as he turned to stare at the wizened
face of the old man at his side, Roy&#8217;s eyes
grew gently luminous; a smile that was tender
curved the lips above the belligerent chin. He
knew that Jake loved his engines, knew perfectly
that the old man fairly doted on them,
cherished them even as a lover his mistress.
Because of the sympathy that he, too, had with
such things, Roy respected the boatman mightily,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
began then and there to grow fond of the
brown and shriveled face.</p>

<p>Billy Walker, for his part, after the first
few moments of suspense, became convinced
that his anticipations of disaster were little
likely to be realized in fact, and thereafter he
gave himself over to delighted contemplation
of the wooded shores, which on either side
sloped gracefully to the water&#8217;s edge. David
Thwing, too, gazed about on the newly budded
beauty of the wilderness with a content made
keen by over-long sojourning in the places
builded by men. It was only Saxe Temple
himself, alone in the stern chair, who looked
around with eyes that just then recked naught
of the scenic loveliness, despite the appeal in
such vistas to one of his beauty-loving temperament.
But his whole interest, now, was centered
on the quest that had brought him to this
remote region. His roving glance was searching
all the stretches of lake and forest wonderingly,
hopefully, fearfully. Here was the place
in which he must win or lose a fortune, according
to the decree of the old man&#8217;s whimsy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
The desire of his dearest dreams surged in
him, the challenge of ambition, the ideals of
art. This wealth, once achieved, would give
freedom to work according to his loftiest aspirations.
A sudden fierce resolve burned in him.
He would succeed, notwithstanding all difficulties
in the path. Fate had given him opportunity:
he would wrest from it victory as well.
His face set itself sternly in lines of strength
... and, then, without any warning, the
<i>Scherzo</i> swung around a densely wooded point
of the shore that had seemed almost to bar the
narrow channel, through which they had been
passing thus far. Now, just before them lay
broad reaches of placid water, a mile in width
there at hand, much wider in the distance beyond.
Low mountains loomed undulant afar,
whence the descending forests ran to a shore
that wound hither and yon in innumerable
inlets, coves and bays, broken often by cliffs.</p>

<p>Yet, even now, Saxe Temple gave no heed
to the loveliness of the spectacle. Instead, his
whole care was fixed on an uncouth, rambling
structure that blotched a clearing visible along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the west shore, a mile away. It was the only
dwelling to be seen anywhere, as far as eye
could reach. The seeker had no doubt that
now, at last, he had his first sight of Abernethey&#8217;s
cottage&mdash;that spot in which his cunning
must meet&mdash;and master&mdash;the cunning of
a dead man, who had made grim jest with the
gold he loved.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE SEARCH BEGINS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AN UNWONTED activity prevailed in the
miser&#8217;s cottage. The presence of Saxe
Temple and his companions brought into the
isolated dwelling a varied and bustling atmosphere,
which, at times, came near confusion.
The one member of the party who permitted
naught to disturb his tranquillity was Billy
Walker, and that because of a chronic aversion
to every form of physical exertion. He contented
himself with holding a sort of informal
court on the porch, sitting at ease with his
massive frame sprawled in a commodious
wicker chair. Mrs. West remained with him
much of the time, while Margaret by turns
joined them, or moved about here and there
as an interested observer of the other three
men, who were already busily searching the
house.</p>

<p>On occasion, Margaret and May Thurston
wandered away together in long strolls by the
lake shore, or over the hills through the forest.
By the circumstances of such companionship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a considerable degree of intimacy was soon
established between the two girls, which was
inexpressibly comforting to the secretary. She
would have delighted to tell this new friend of
the engagement that existed between herself
and the engineer, but she had passed her word
not to do so, and it never occurred to her as
possible that she should break it. At times,
Masters joined the girls in their rambles, but
that avaricious gentleman, though eager to
press his suit with Margaret could not often
bear to absent himself from the scene of operations
that had to do with the treasure. So,
for the most part, he either joined the group
on the porch, or gave himself over to loitering
hidden in the woods, at a point a few hundred
yards to the south, where a thick screen
of undergrowth effectually offered a barrier
against observation from the cottage. By such
espionage, he was sure to be instantly advised
concerning any discovery of a clue, as it would
create excitement among those on the piazza.
He would have preferred to remain constantly
among the searchers, but this was patently
impossible. Masters was by no means lacking
in shrewdness, however great his shortcomings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the way of respect for <i>meum et tuum</i>, and he
was both sensitive and sensible enough to know
that his company was not especially agreeable
to Temple and his friends in their exploration
of the house.</p>

<p>It was, in truth, rather curious to note the
various opinions held in reference to the engineer
by the four men engaged in seeking Abernethey&#8217;s
treasure. Masters had been introduced
to them by May on the morning after
their arrival at the cottage, and had shown
himself as friendly as possible. But, in accordance
with the usual effect he had on men,
the impression created by him on each of the
four was distinctly unpleasant. Saxe Temple
felt an intuitive dislike, which he was at no
pains to explain. Billy Walker regarded the
engineer with a mingling of amusement and
disdain, ill concealed, and he did not scruple
afterward to describe the visitor as a peculiarly
obnoxious romantic pirate, with a flamboyant
veneer of the <i>Quartier Latin</i>. But he refused
to take the fellow with much seriousness. In
this respect, he differed from Roy Morton, who
made it a rule to be uniformly suspicious of all
things and all persons, and lived up to this rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
with finical fidelity. He immediately characterized
the engineer as a completely base and
designing person, one of whom all decent and
honest men might well beware. He proved
his contentions quite to his own satisfaction by
physiognomy, by phrenology, by chiromancy,
by the sixth sense and by the fourth dimension.
David Thwing, who was ordinarily a
kindly soul, made some small effort to combat
the severity of Roy&#8217;s strictures, but the philanthropic
attempt failed dismally of appreciation&mdash;which
result troubled David not at all,
since his heart was not in the task.</p>

<p>Ensued a week of feverish activity on the
part of Saxe and his friends, in which Billy
Walker was as busy as any, although his toil
was exclusively mental, while his body
remained in its customary lethargic condition.
By day and by night, he devoted himself to
examination of the problem that confronted
his friend, and by day and by night the other
three carried out his every suggestion. Unfortunately,
however, for Saxe&#8217;s hopes of inheritance,
their first hurried search of the cottage
resulted in naught save weariness and dismay.
Of anything in the nature of a clue, they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
no least trace.</p>

<p>Billy Walker delivered the final decree in
a council held by the four, after dinner on
the seventh day. It had so chanced that the
friends were alone together in the chief room
of the cottage, which was the music-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve addled my wits in vain,&#8221; Billy
Walker confessed, dolefully. &#8220;Until there
shall have been an accumulation of new intellectual
energy on my part, I shall be able to
offer you no theory as to the actual hiding-place
so ingeniously selected by the late
lamented Mr. Abernethey&mdash;to whose ashes,
peace! While I am thus recuperating, however,
you, my children, shall not be idle&mdash;oh,
by no manner of means. On the contrary,
you shall be very busy, indeed, after
the method prescribed by inexorable logic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to think that a little luck
just now would help more than a lot of
logic,&#8221; Saxe declared, gloomily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the oracle, anyhow,&#8221; David
Thwing urged, in his always kindly voice.
&#8220;You see,&#8221; he went on whimsically, &#8220;Billy is
a specialist in thinking: he doesn&#8217;t do anything
except think. So, we must respect his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
thinking. Otherwise, we could not respect
our friend at all.&#8221; David&#8217;s big, protruding
eyes, magnified by the heavy lenses of his
eyeglasses, beamed benignantly on his three
companions.</p>

<p>The one thus dubiously lauded grunted
disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Panegyrics apart,&#8221; he resumed, in his
roughly rumbling tones, &#8220;there appears at
this time but one course of procedure. To
wit: Tomorrow morning, you must start on
an exhaustive search of the whole house.
Hitherto, you have made only a superficial
examination. This has failed miserably.
Now, the scrutiny must be made microscopic.&#8221;</p>

<p>There could be no gainsaying the utterance.
As the speaker had declared, it was
the command of the inevitable logic presented
by the situation. The hearers gave
grumbling assent to the wisdom of the suggestion&mdash;with
the exception of Roy Morton,
who, curled lazily in the depths of the morris
chair, was staring vacantly at the elaborate
carving of the wainscoting, and smoking an
especially fat Egyptian cigarette. Now, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
suddenly sat upright, and his gaze was
turned on his companions, who had looked
up at his abrupt movement. Roy&#8217;s eyes were
hard; his chin was thrust forward, in the
fashion characteristic of him when the spirit
of combat flared high, which, to tell the
truth, was rather often. He spoke with
apparent seriousness, but Thwing, who had
been through some adventures of a violent
sort in his company, noted that a significant
excess of amiability in his tones, which was
always to be heard on critical occasions, was
now wanting.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one simple and sure way to
success,&#8221; Roy declared authoritatively. &#8220;We
must burgle.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were ejaculations of astonishment
from his curious hearers.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; he explained blandly, fixing
his steel-blue eyes grimly on the wondering
Billy Walker. &#8220;We must rifle the
lawyer&#8217;s safe. Of course, the lawyer whom
Abernethey employed has exact instructions
as to how to come on the treasure. All we
have to do, then, is to break into his office,
carrying an oxy-acetylene blow-pipe, cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
open the safe, find the secret instructions,
copy them off, and afterward duly retrieve
the gold at our leisure; besides,&#8221; he concluded,
with great complacency, &#8220;I know a
first-class safe-blower, to help us on the job.
I did him a favor once. He&#8217;ll be glad to do
me a kindness, in turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>A chorus of protests came from Saxe and
Billy, to which, at last, with much apparent
reluctance, Roy yielded, and definitely,
though sulkily, withdrew his ingenious predatory
plan. But David, the while, chuckled
contentedly, for he was apt at a jest&mdash;and,
too, he had known Roy more closely than
had the other two.</p>

<p>Since the working schedule had been thus
happily determined on the side of law and
order, the friends gave themselves over to
an interval of social relaxation for the
remainder of the evening, during which
period, at the suggestion of David, the subject
of the treasure was taboo. Roy, who
was fond of music, and had himself once
possessed no mean measure of skill on the
violoncello, now besought Saxe to try the
piano, for hitherto their whole attention had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been given to the business in hand, to the
exclusion of all else. David, also, who doted
on music, though without any technical
training, added his entreaties. Billy Walker,
who esteemed music about as highly as a
cat does water, was complacent enough not
to protest, which was the utmost that might
be expected of him under the circumstances.
Saxe went to the piano very willingly, for he
was in a mood of nervous tension that
craved the emotional relaxation of harmony.</p>

<p>Saxe played with a good degree of excellence
in his technique, although he was far
from being such a master of the instrument
as had been the dead owner. But the essential
charm of the younger man&#8217;s interpretation
lay in the delicate truth of his sympathy.
His intelligent sensitiveness seemed,
indeed, catholic in its scope. Whether he
toyed daintily with a graceful <i>appoggiatura</i>
from Chopin, or crashed an astonishing dissonance
from Strauss, he equally felt and
revealed the emotion that had been in the
composer&#8217;s soul. Hardly had he begun,
when Mrs. West entered from the porch,
and after her came Margaret. Presently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
May made her appearance, with Masters at
her side. Only Jake and his wife, in the
kitchen, remained unattracted. They had
already heard from their late master sufficient
music to last them a lifetime. The
audience was sympathetic enough to encourage
the player, and Saxe remained at the
piano for a long time, to the satisfaction of
all his hearers&mdash;even that of Billy Walker,
who was shamelessly dozing.</p>

<p>Finally, the musician&#8217;s attention, during a
pause, was attracted to a stack of music,
which was lying on top of a cabinet, at the
right of the piano. He rose, and, going to
it, began glancing over the sheets. His eyes
lighted with admiration as he noted the
various compositions in the collection. In
this examination of the music, he realized,
as he had not done hitherto, the virtuosity
of that dead miser who had made him the
possible heir to wealth. For here was naught
save the most worthy in the world of musical
art. There was not a single number of the
many assembled that was not a masterpiece
of its kind. In its entirety, the series presented
the very highest forms of musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
expression, the supreme achievement, both
intellectual and emotional, in the art. For
the first time, Saxe felt a gust of tenderness
toward the lonely old man, for the sake of
their brotherhood in a great love. And,
then, at the very bottom of the heap, Saxe
came on a single sheet, which drew his particular
attention.</p>

<p>The page showed a few measures written
in manuscript. This fact alone was sufficient
to make the sheet distinctive in the
collection, inasmuch as it was solitary of its
sort. Every other composition was from
editions by the best publishers. With his
newly-aroused interest in Abernethey, it
befell that Saxe was pleased thus to come
on a composition which, he made sure, must
have been from the pen of Abernethey himself.
Yet, as he scanned the few bars, the
young man experienced a feeling of vivid
disappointment, for the work was by no possibility
of a kind to compel particular admiration;
so, at least, it seemed to him just then.
With a sense of disillusionment concerning
the quality of the dead miser&#8217;s genius, Saxe
carried the sheet of music to the piano,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
where he placed it on the rack, then began
to play. As the first chord sounded, May
Thurston, seated in a chair near the door,
made a movement of surprise. Afterward,
as she rested quietly in her place, there lay
on her face a look of melancholy that was
very near dejection.</p>

<p>The music that Saxe played was this:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">[<a href="music/lake_mystery_music.midi">Listen</a>]</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>Thus, Saxe Temple played the few simple
phrases, over which the old miser had lingered
so long one desolate night. But, now,
a vast difference appeared in the manner
with which the music was sped. Abernethey
had rendered the composition with astonishing
intensity of emotion. He had interpreted
the harsh measures with exquisite,
though melancholy, tenderness; he had
clanged them forth with the spirit of frantic
appeal, with hot passion in the uncouth
numbers, with crass, savage abandonment&mdash;again,
with the superimposing of mighty
harmonies, vast, massive, dignified. Now,
the genius was gone from the reading. Saxe
Temple felt no least degree of sympathy for
this crude, unpleasant fragment. On the
contrary, the piece affected him only disagreeably.
To his musical sense, this creation
by the miser was peculiarly offensive.
Yet, through some subliminal channel, the
stark sequence of the rhythm laid thrall on
him, so that he ran over the score not once,
but many times. Nevertheless, he always
set the music forth nakedly, unadorned by
any graces of variety in the interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
undraped by ingenious Harmonies. He
played merely the written notes, played
them with precision&mdash;reluctantly; and, when
finally, he had made an end, he still sat on
at the piano, staring toward the written
page, as one vaguely troubled by a mystery.</p>

<p>It was May Thurston who broke the little
interval of silence that followed after the
music ended:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that before, Mr. Temple,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;many, many times.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe whirled on the piano stool to face
the girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, and there was a note of
bewilderment in his voice; &#8220;I should imagine
so. As it is in manuscript, it was probably
composed by Mr. Abernethey himself. But
I must say that I&#8217;m greatly disappointed in
it. I can&#8217;t discover any particular merit in
it. You know, he left me all his manuscripts.
I&#8217;ve had no time to look at them,
however, as they only arrived the day we
left New York. So, I was especially interested
in this, to learn something of him, and
this teaches me nothing at all concerning
him, or, if it does&mdash;&#8221; He broke off, unwilling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to voice his candid judgment of the manuscript&#8217;s
merits. He turned to Roy, who
lounged in a window seat, smoking the
inevitable cigarette. &#8220;What did you think
of it?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly ghastly!&#8221; came the sententious
answer. &#8220;I was wondering what on earth
you were up to&mdash;and hoping for the best.
Yes, ghastly!&#8221;</p>

<p>May Thurston laughed, but there was
little merriment in her notes.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what it is&mdash;ghastly!&#8221;
She shuddered slightly, and glanced across
the room toward Margaret, as if in quest
of sympathy. &#8220;It is ghastly. It got on my
nerves frightfully. Mr. Abernethey was
forever playing it, along at the last&mdash;and I
used to enjoy his playing so, too! I love
music, and he was simply wonderful. I&#8217;ve
heard most of the great players, and it seems
to me that he was as good as any of them.
His technique was magnificent. He told me
once that, since many years, he had had an
absolute mastery of the instrument physically.
He had only to think and to feel the
spirit of the music. He said that the sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
response of his body was wholly automatic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the ideal, of course,&#8221; Saxe agreed,
with a sigh. &#8220;I only wish that I had attained
to it myself! Perhaps, he weakened a bit at
the last&mdash;when he did this, you know?&#8221; He
looked at May inquiringly, as he made the
suggestion.</p>

<p>But the girl shook her head, resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she said, with an air of finality.
&#8220;Up to the very day of his death, there was
no breaking down of Mr. Abernethey&#8217;s mind.
Yet, he was always playing that piece at the
last. Only, he played it in a thousand ways&mdash;never
twice alike&mdash;and always ghastly!&#8221;
Again the girl shuddered slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s curious,&#8221; Saxe said. He swung
about on the piano-stool, and sat staring
somberly at the written page.</p>

<p>Billy Walker innocently cleared the
atmosphere. He sat erect, rubbing his eyes
brazenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I liked that piece,&#8221; he declared,
genially. &#8220;It&#8217;s got some swing to it, some
go&mdash;yes, rather! Best thing you&#8217;ve played,
if anybody asks me.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8220;Nobody did,&#8221; Roy retorted, sourly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Billy Walker, though
totally tone-deaf, had been granted a considerable
capacity for the enjoyment of
rhythm. The composition that distressed
May Thurston by its ghastliness had cheered
him with the steady drumming of its chords;
the law of compensation works in curious
ways.</p>

<small>THE SIXTH SENSE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">&#8220;WHAT I don&#8217;t like about women,&#8221;
exclaimed Roy Morton, with an
inflection of disgust, &#8220;is the kind of men they
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the morning of another day, and
the exhaustive search commanded by Billy
Walker as the mouthpiece of inexorable
logic had begun. The voice of the oracle
could at this moment be heard from the
porch, where he was engaged in pleasant
conversation with Mrs. West, while his three
friends were busy with the actual work of
investigation. They were in the small room
opening off the hall, on the ground floor,
which had been used by the late owner of
the cottage as a sort of office. There, he
had kept all of his business papers&mdash;at least
as far as the knowledge of his secretary
went. A flat-top desk in the center of the
room contained a number of drawers, and
in one corner stood a small iron safe. Under
the terms of the will, every freedom was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
accorded to the searchers, and now safe and
drawers had been opened for their convenience
by May Thurston, who thus followed
the instructions she had received from the
lawyer. At the moment when Roy made
his rather bitter remark concerning the
nature of womankind, he had just observed,
through a window that looked out to the
south, a trio strolling along the lake shore.
The three were Margaret, May and the
ubiquitous Masters. It was the presence of
the engineer that had aroused the indignation
of Roy, and had caused him thus cynically
to stigmatize feminine indiscretion in
friendship. Himself a devotee of the fair sex,
though shockingly irresponsible as an eligible
bachelor, it irked him mightily that the
requirements of his present relation to Saxe
were such as to hold him there, poring over
a motley of sordid bills, receipts, and other
financial memoranda, the while a scoundrelly
nincompoop (so he secretly termed the
engineer) strutted abroad with two charming
girls.</p>

<p>David laughed at the disgust in his friend&#8217;s
voice, for he, too, had observed the passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
of the three, and he understood perfectly the
jealousy that underlay Roy&#8217;s displeasure in
the situation. He paused in his task of conning
the year&#8217;s milk bills of one Eleazer
Sneddy, lighted a cigarette, and inhaled the
fumes with a sigh of deep gratification.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind being in his place myself,
Roy,&#8221; he said, placidly.</p>

<p>The grumbler scowled at his too penetrant
crony. Saxe looked up from a sheet of foolscap,
covered in the minute handwriting of
the miser with long columns of figures by
which were set forth details of the expenditures
for a month in the matter of postage.
He, too, paused, welcoming any diversion
from the uncongenial labor, and lighted a
cigarette with manifest relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be in whose place, Dave?&#8221; he questioned,
idly.</p>

<p>Roy attempted a distraction from the
topic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;This adventure isn&#8217;t
what it&#8217;s been cracked up to be&mdash;no gore, no
gold, no anything, except a parcel of musty
papers. I have just finished the thrilling
items of tenpenny nails in the matter of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
shingling the cottage; I suppose that poor
old miser had a spasm every time he paid
for a pound of them. In fact, I&#8217;m sure of it,
because I get psychosympathetically those
same spasms in going over the charges.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Psychosympathetically is good,&#8221; David
generously declared. Then, he turned to
Saxe. &#8220;Roy just saw Masters out for a walk
with the girls, and it stirred him to envy,
naturally enough. It did me, too, for there
are certainly two unusually nice girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy&#8217;s gloomy face lighted in an instant,
marvelously. His eyes grew very blue and
soft, his lips curved in the smile that made
all women like him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Peaches!&#8221; he ejaculated, with candid
enthusiasm. &#8220;But what a revelation it was
when little Miss Thurston took off her spectacles.
A demure angel appeared where
before had been a dumpy New England
schoolmarm.... I have discovered the
important fact that spectacles on a short
woman take exactly two inches from her
height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you informed Miss Thurston of
your interesting discovery?&#8221; David inquired.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; was the answer; &#8220;but I shall,
at the first opportunity. It&#8217;s a crime for any
woman not to be as beautiful as she possibly
can, every moment of her life. Think of the
wholesome happiness that loveliness gives to
every observer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the other women,&#8221; Saxe suggested.</p>

<p>Roy disdained the interruption:</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet,&#8221; he continued, energetically,
&#8220;there are women, good women, mind you,
who give away soup, but look like frumps,
and actually believe that they are doing their
duty. Why, sirs, they minister to the bellies
of a dozen, perhaps, while they shock the
finest sensibilities of the souls of a thousand
who have to look at &#8217;em. And they believe
that they have done their duty. It&#8217;s shameful.
Are bellies more than souls?&#8221;</p>

<p>The thoughts of Saxe were busy with the
other of the two girls, Margaret West; and
now he spoke of her, reverting to Roy&#8217;s
diatribe concerning the chief duty of women.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret West certainly fulfills all her
obligation,&#8221; he observed. There was a
quality of repressed admiration in his voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which set the observant David to thinking.
&#8220;She is beautiful at all times. It&#8217;s a delight
to look at her.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others nodded agreement, but, in the
same moment, Roy grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beware!&#8221; he advised, mockingly.
&#8220;Remember that that girl, so young and
seemingly so innocent, is your deadly enemy.
Don&#8217;t let the spell of her loveliness lull you
into a fancied security, in which you may be
caught off guard. Again, I bid you beware.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What on earth are you raving about?&#8221;
Saxe demanded, in genuine astonishment,
&#8220;but you&#8217;re merely joking, of course&mdash;though
I must say that I don&#8217;t exactly see
the humor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps my language was a trifle extravagant,&#8221;
Roy conceded; &#8220;but as to the essential
fact, why, I stand by what I said. Margaret
West is, naturally, your enemy. There can&#8217;t
be a shadow of doubt as to that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret West my enemy!&#8221; the incredulous
Saxe repeated, in a voice that was indignant.
&#8220;Why, man, the idea&#8217;s absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy wagged his head, sapiently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Human nature is human nature,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
vouchsafed. &#8220;Money is power. There are
a dozen truisms that I might utter very
aptly at this present juncture, but I refrain.
It so happens, however, that, in the event
of your failing to discover the hiding-place
of the gold so artfully concealed by the late
lamented, this same Margaret West will fall
heiress to exactly one-half of that gold.
Therefore, inevitably, she is your enemy.
Such is the law of our civilization, in which
gold plays the vital part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe was frowning. He turned to David,
with open impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear the like of that nonsense?&#8221;
he demanded.</p>

<p>David smoked thoughtfully, and paused
for a few seconds before he answered. Then,
he smiled his usual kindly smile, as he spoke
decisively:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, it does seem a bit preposterous,
first off,&#8221; he admitted. &#8220;But, you see,
the common facts of experience lend color
to Roy&#8217;s argument. Miss West is a charming
girl, and doesn&#8217;t seem a bit the sordid,
avaricious type, and yet&mdash;well, you never can
tell. Women are kittle cattle, and there&#8217;s a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pot of money concerned. I&#8217;m thinking she
wouldn&#8217;t be quite plain human, if she didn&#8217;t
want you to fail. Of course she does&mdash;she
must&mdash;yes, Roy is right enough, Miss West
is your natural enemy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe was silenced, and, in a manner of
speaking, convinced as well. He was forced
to admit the plausibility of the reasoning
of his friends, although his feeling was still
bitterly opposed to any admission that their
contention was just in this particular
instance. It occurred to him that, were the
case reversed, he would undoubtedly desire
the seeker&#8217;s discomfiture with all his heart,
would, in fine, regard the seeker as his
natural enemy&mdash;just as Roy had designated
Margaret West to be his natural enemy.
Nevertheless, something within him forbade
that he should esteem this girl as one hostile
to himself. The color in Saxe&#8217;s cheeks
deepened a little. Of a sudden, it was borne
in on his consciousness that there existed a
most cogent reason why he could not regard
Margaret West as an enemy. It was because
he so earnestly desired her as a friend. In
that instant of illumination, he realized that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
never before in his life had he longed for
the friendship of woman as now he yearned
for that of Margaret West. A strange confusion
fell on him. He did not quite understand
the emotion that welled in his spirit;
it was something new to his experience,
something subtle, bafflingly elusive&mdash;and very,
very sweet.</p>

<p>Saxe was recalled to the business of the
moment by the pained voice of Roy:</p>

<p>&#8220;Digging the drain cost six dollars and
ninety-eight cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like a department store,&#8221; was
David&#8217;s amused comment. &#8220;I learn that, on
the sixteenth of last January, nine cents was
expended in the purchase of the succulent
onion.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy groaned with dismal heartiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I embark on an adventure. I crave
adventure, I seek it in far places and near,
wherefore I come hither with my bold companions,
a-hunting a chest of gold. Forthwith,
I become an uncertified private
accountant. What hideous degradation! I
tell you, Saxe, I&#8217;m mighty sick of this job.
I&#8217;d just as lief be assistant bookkeeper in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
tannery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why tannery?&#8221; David inquired. He
pushed the heap of papers aside, and lighted
another cigarette, highly pleased with the
diversion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because a tannery happened to be the
most disagreeable place I could think of at
the moment,&#8221; was the simple explanation.
&#8220;Smells, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; David admitted. His
jagged nose wrinkled violently, as memory
smote his olfactory nerves.</p>

<p>Saxe seized on a topic that promised some
measure of distraction from his crowding
thoughts:</p>

<p>&#8220;Myself, I don&#8217;t think much of this
method.&#8221; He waved a hand contemptuously
toward the litter of papers on the desk before
them. &#8220;It seems to me that we&#8217;re just losing
time in wading through all this trash. But
what shall we do, instead? This is a part
of the exhaustive search.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy sprang up with an exclamation of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;No Christian gentleman, not even a miser,
would concoct the diabolical idea of preserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
a clue to his gold pots amid trash of this sort;
besides, I have a presentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a presentiment!&#8221; There was a note of
scoffing in Saxe&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>But David, in the years since their graduation,
had journeyed with Roy through strange
places, and so had come to know the whimsical
nature intimately, with a consequent respect
for some seemingly fantastic idiosyncracies.
Now, he stared at his friend expectantly, with
no hint of derision in the look.</p>

<p>Roy smiled quizzically, as he met David&#8217;s
earnestly inquiring gaze:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not so skeptical, eh, Dave?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>David smiled wryly, and shook his head. In
his gentle, goggling eyes was reminiscence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s borne in on my consciousness,&#8221; Roy
continued, rather pedantically, &#8220;that the clue
isn&#8217;t here, and it&#8217;s not to be found by tedious,
disgusting ransacking of scraps, like these
we&#8217;ve been wasting our time on here, but, on
the contrary, will be revealed to us in some
much more curious manner. In fact, I feel
that we shall succeed, but that our success will
come in an apparently chance suggestion from
some one of us, which will really be in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nature of an inspiration. You see, Dave,&#8221; he
concluded, staring at the other intently, &#8220;the
idea of the hiding-place is well compacted as a
thought-form, for the old man was thinking
of his treasure and its concealment hour after
hour, day after day. The influence is here,
ready to affect anyone sensitive enough to be
susceptible to such vibration. For my part,
I&#8217;m sure some one of us will presently become
obsessed by some seemingly absurd idea&mdash;an
idea, in all likelihood, quite irrational&mdash;that
idea will lead us to victory, and to the Abernethey
gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe laughed, a bit sourly. Roy&#8217;s psychic
gasconading would have been more amusing
with another theme. It seemed, in truth,
rather heartless jesting, when a fortune was
the issue. To suggest that wealth must await
the vagaries of a thought-form&#8217;s impact on
somebody&#8217;s consciousness, which wouldn&#8217;t
know even what had hit it! Of all preposterous
things! It was brutal, too.</p>

<p>David sprang to his feet, his big, brown eyes
shining alertly through the eyeglasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Praise be!&#8221; he cried. Instantly, thereafter,
he proceeded to the execution of a clog-dance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
which he performed with astonishing precision
and swiftness, while Roy clapped the rhythm
with foot and hands.</p>

<p>Saxe looked on in unconcealed disgust. At
the conclusion of the <i>pas seul</i>, he lifted his
voice in complaint:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of all the heartless, unsympathetic
wretches! If it was your money, you might
not feel so devilishly tickled.&#8221; He glared at
the unabashed two accusingly.</p>

<p>David strode forward, and clapped his
friend on the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your hosses!&#8221; he cried. A crisp note
of authority was in his voice. &#8220;Why, old fellow,
this is just what I&#8217;ve been waiting for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; Saxe exclaimed, with sarcasm.
Then, he shrugged his shoulders resignedly.
He found himself fairly bemused by this madness
on the part of his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; David went on. His manner
proved that, however extravagant in his credulity,
he was quite sincere. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been about
more than a bit with Roy, and in some infernally
tough places, too, let me tell you.&#8221; Saxe
nodded assent. &#8220;Well, the fact of the matter
is simply this: From experience, I&#8217;ve learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
that, when Roy has a hunch, it goes&mdash;that&#8217;s all.
He has sensed things, as he calls it, and our
acting on the knowledge we got in that way
has saved our lives&mdash;more than once&mdash;so,
here, I&#8217;ve been waiting for his sixth sense to
get busy, and it has, at last. I was beginning to
get discouraged. Now, everything&#8217;s all right.
Roy&#8217;s got his hunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Saxe could voice utter disbelief in a
trust so fantastic, he was interrupted by Roy
himself. That intermittent seer, who had been
smoking with an expression of infantile contentment
on his face, sprang lithely and noiselessly
to his feet. While Saxe and David
stared curiously, he leaned close to them, and
whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s somebody listening. Look out of
the window, Saxe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy had been sitting for some time with his
back to the one window in the room, while the
other two had been facing it. There had come
no sound from without. Now, instinctively
obedient to the command, Saxe darted to the
window, which was open, and thrust out his
head. Close to the wall of the cottage, within
a yard of him, stood Hartley Masters in an attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of absorbed attention.</p>

<p>Without attracting the notice of the eaves-dropper,
Saxe drew back, and turned to his
friends. He nodded affirmation of Roy&#8217;s surmise.
In the gaze with which he scrutinized
the amateur psychic, there was a curious commingling
of bewilderment, respect and chagrin.</p>

<p>David threw back his head, and laughed joyously,
scorning the listener, and spoke his
mind:</p>

<p>&#8220;When Roy gets a hunch&mdash;watch out!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>HAPHAZARD QUESTING</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MASTERS, who was not minded to let the
value of a small weekly stipend stand
between him and the possession of riches, had
now abandoned even the pretense of work. He
let it be known, casually, at the cottage that he
was temporarily idle, while awaiting orders.
As a matter of fact, he was awaiting the dismissal
that now could not be long delayed.
To May, however, he confessed the truth, that
he had chosen to sacrifice a paltry certainty
for the sake of possible wealth. She had protested
against the recklessness of his conduct,
but her pleas had fallen on deaf ears. Masters
went his way of crafty greed without a moment&#8217;s
faltering. He had exulted on learning
from the conversation overheard among the
three friends that the systematized search was
to be abandoned in favor of a foolish fancy&mdash;as
he deemed it. While Saxe Temple and his
companions loitered in expectation of some
psychic guidance, Masters would give himself
to the quest with an energy that must win him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the victory. It was in a very cheerful frame
of mind that he betook himself to the cottage
on the following morning. Upon his arrival,
however, he was at once confronted with a new
phase of the situation, which filled him with
rage.</p>

<p>The engineer found Mrs. West and Billy
Walker chatting cozily on the porch, as usual.
Mrs. West beamed kindly in her greeting, for
she enjoyed the breezy manner of this handsome
young man. Billy merely grunted. To
judge from the expression of his face, the
utterance were better inarticulate.</p>

<p>Masters leaned his long length against a pillar
at the head of the flight of steps, and joined
genially in the conversation for a few minutes,
despite the manifest grumpiness of Billy
Walker, who, never a courtier, was at no pains
to conceal his distaste for the engineer&#8217;s
society. Mrs. West, however, was amiability
itself, and Masters was minded to ignore the
superciliousness of the other man&#8217;s manner,
though fully conscious of it. He felt that,
under the circumstances, he could ill afford to
be too finical over such a trifle, notwithstanding
the irritation to his vanity. So he rolled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
cigarette from the chip tobacco and wheat-straw
paper which he affected, and chatted
jauntily with Mrs. West. When he deemed
that a sufficient interval had elapsed, the
engineer prepared the way to continue his
delayed search of the cottage:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just take a look inside. Miss Thurston
promised me a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>Forthwith, he reprobated himself for having
employed this particular ruse, for Mrs. West
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Thurston isn&#8217;t in the cottage, Mr.
Masters. You will find her down at the boat-house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Masters thanked her with his most winning
smile, and strolled away toward the lake. Mrs.
West looked after him with a femininely
appreciative smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a delightful gentleman Mr. Masters
is!&#8221; she remarked innocently to Billy; by way
of answer, there came a rumbling, luckily
again quite inarticulate.</p>

<p>Forced thus by his own error to postpone
the anticipated investigation, Masters was in
no pleasant mood as he made his way to the
boat-house, with the intention of venting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
spite on the girl who loved him. But even this
relief was not to be vouchsafed him yet. On
the contrary, his displeasure was swiftly to
become wrath, venomed by alarm; for, as he
drew near the boat-house, he heard a chorus
of merry voices. Instantly, he realized that
the other men were here where he had expected
to find only May, and possibly Miss West. Fury
mounted high at the thought. A fierce, unreasoning
jealousy bit at him. So great was his
emotion under these confederate causes that,
for once, he forgot discretion, and passed with
hasty steps around the boat-house, totally heedless
of the distraught expression on his usually
debonair countenance.</p>

<p>As the engineer rounded the corner, a scowl
bent his brows at sight of the scene before him.
The summer morning was of bland sun and
gentle airs to set the care-free in a mood for
lazy delights. The group of four, it was plain,
had yielded to the soft seduction of the hour,
for their faces were radiant. Roy Morton was
sitting, in a boyish attitude, on the top of a
snubbing post, about which his long legs were
twined for security&#8217;s sake, while May Thurston
cuddled at his feet, her face uplifted, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
eyes rapt, as she listened to some tale told from
the book of his adventures. The spectacle
infuriated Masters, and new fuel fed the flame
as his eyes fell on the other two. These had
their backs to the newcomer, who approached
immediately behind them. Margaret sat at
the edge of the dock, leaning against a post,
in a posture of perfect comfort peculiarly
exasperating to the observer. A little to the
right, and so placed as to face the girl, Saxe
sat, with his feet folded under him like a Turk.
Masters noted, even in this gusty moment, that
his rival was an especially good-looking young
man, of the shaven, clean-cut type most
esteemed by the contemporary illustrator. The
engineer appreciated the type of which he himself
was the exemplar, and appreciated it indeed
at its full worth, but, having a fair degree
of intelligence, he knew that women admired
also the vigorous, wholesome and cultured man,
of the kind there before him. Though he had
not the least fear for his own prowess where
the hearts of women were concerned, he could
not disguise from himself the fact that here
was one who might easily prove a dangerous
rival were the opportunity given.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Saxe had just done with explaining to Miss
West the reason for the new era of idleness,
which the day had inaugurated for himself and
his two companions. With Billy Walker, the
era was merely continued.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Saxe had cast a
reconnoitering glance toward Roy before
beginning his recital, and that he held his voice
lowered throughout the telling. He knew that
this confidence to the girl, whom, to a certain
extent, at least, the others distrusted, might be
deemed by them the height of folly. But he
was past respecting their opinions in aught
that concerned her and him. So, he told her
freely of the decision to abandon systematic
search, in favor of a recondite dependence
upon occult inspiration. Margaret&#8217;s interest
in the narrative was of the sincerest, and it
delighted him. Her manner of receiving the
information was proof enough to his mind that
she harbored no least desire for his failure in
this undertaking. His heart was in a glow of
happiness, as she bent a little toward him, her
face all eagerness, her limpid eyes dazzlingly
blue in the brilliant light. She met his gaze
squarely, as she voiced her protest against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
course adopted:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but, Mr. Temple, the time&#8217;s so short&mdash;less
than three weeks now&mdash;it isn&#8217;t safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>The two were in this attitude of absorbed
intimacy when Masters&#8217; glance fell upon them.
The evident intensity of their interest in each
other capped the climax of his rage. He strode
forward, with a sneer arching the heavy mustache.
At the sound of his steps, the group
looked up, and, in varying fashion, each of the
four showed unmistakable signs of dissatisfaction
at this interruption of the conversation.
Masters so far forgot his manners as to make
no response to the rather curt nods with which
the two men greeted him. Instead, he halted
abruptly, and stared, glowering, at Margaret
and Saxe. After the first moment of astonishment
at the engineer&#8217;s discourteous manner,
Saxe&#8217;s expression of animation died out suddenly,
to be replaced by a set severity that augured
ill for him who should challenge it. Roy&#8217;s
jaw shot out a little, and the veil dropped over
his eyes, which, a moment before, had been
mild and deep. Margaret could only regard
the malevolent face of Masters with sheer
amazement, as his wrathful eyes met hers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>It was May who saved the situation. She
sprang to her feet with a little cry, which
might have been of pleasure or of pain. With
the intuition of a loving woman, she seized
instantly on the fact that something had
thrown her lover from his customary poise.
Without a particle of hesitation, she employed
the first ruse suggested by her woman&#8217;s wit:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you did come, after all&mdash;in spite of
that horrid tooth!&#8221;</p>

<p>She had no least idea as to the cause that
had put the man in this tempestuous temper,
but she realized the necessity of restoring him
to some measure of self-control ere he should
commit himself hopelessly by a violent outbreak.
The fiction concerning the tooth rose
to her lips without conscious volition on her
part, the grimace with which Masters faced
her, though merely a physical symbol of fury,
might well have had its origin in a spasm of
pain.</p>

<p>As he met May&#8217;s dismayed and imploring
eyes, sanity rushed back on the engineer. By a
stern effort, he fought back the flooding wrath.
His face worked a little, then settled into a
grim repose. While the others waited in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
silence for the outcome, he suddenly smiled,
crookedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had a frightful twinge while I was coming
through the woods, but that didn&#8217;t matter
so much, because I was alone, and could make
faces, and say just what I wanted to. But I
do think it was unkind of fate to visit the worst
twinge of a jumping toothache on me at the
very instant when I stepped into the presence
of company; forgive me the face I made,
please.&#8221; His big eyes were shining gently now,
where before they had been blazing. His
demeanor was convincing to the unsuspicious
Margaret, who, having once experienced a
jumping toothache, was prepared to accept it
as full justification for any desperate deed. Of
the others, May felt a profound relief in finding
that he had so swiftly made use of her
offered help, and, for the moment, this satisfaction
contented her; Roy adjusted his jaw
in a less-belligerent fashion, as contempt took
the place of anger; Saxe found himself smiling,
genuinely amused over the fancy of so
piratical-seeming a person in the throes of
toothache. Neither of the men, however, had
the slightest doubt that May had offered an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
ingenious excuse to account for the engineer&#8217;s
savage manner; and forthwith, Saxe and Roy
began to wonder mightily as to what, in fact,
had occurred to destroy so completely the ordinary
suavity of this young gentleman whom
they cordially detested.</p>

<p>Mrs. West sent her servant, Chris, in quest
of Margaret, and, soon afterward, May and
Masters also went to the cottage, without troubling
much for an excuse, so that the two
friends were left alone together on the dock.
But, before they had time to voice their common
astonishment over the scene that had just
passed, they were confronted by Jake, who, as
they looked up at his approach, bobbed his head
at them, and winked with a fine air of mystery.
When he spoke, he addressed himself directly
to Roy, for the love each of them bore to niceties
of mechanism sealed their sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s new, Jake?&#8221; Roy demanded,
amiably.</p>

<p>Another series of bobbings and winks
emphasized the importance of the forthcoming
communication. Then, finally, he spoke in a
husky whisper, for secrecy&#8217;s sake:</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I&#8217;d look in on ye, and tell ye I got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
an idee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Capital, Jake!&#8221; Roy&#8217;s tone was distinctly
encouraging. &#8220;What&#8217;s it all about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; Jake began, with manifest
pride in the importance of the coming revelation.
&#8220;You see, I know somethin&#8217; &#8217;bout the
house up thar&mdash;&#8221; he nodded over his shoulder
in the direction of the cottage&mdash;&#8220;that you
chaps don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s what!&#8221;</p>

<p>At this preamble, Saxe, who had been giving
only desultory attention to the old man,
quickly ceased looking out over the lake, and
gave ear to what the boatman was saying,
while Roy, too, displayed a new interest. Jake
was plainly gratified by the effect he had
wrought on his hearers, and he proceeded with
a note of pride in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing &#8217;bout that-thar cottage
that you ain&#8217;t onto, and, thinkin&#8217; as how you
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t likely to be, I says to myself, says I, I&#8217;ll
jest put &#8217;em wise, seein&#8217; as how ye come, to a
kind o&#8217; standstill, as it were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Jake,&#8221; Roy said. &#8220;We surely need
any help we can get at this stage of the game.
Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cottage was an uncouth structure. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
had originally been a story-and-a-half building,
and to this Abernethey had added a sort of
wing to make the music-room, and eventually
this portion had become the principal bulk of
the edifice, for domestic offices had been joined
to it, and a second story set above, in which
were a number of bedrooms. It was in reference
to this second story on the wing that Jake
now came with tidings for the treasure-seekers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Si Hatch did that-thar job,&#8221; he said, with
a wheezy chuckle of amused reminiscence. &#8220;Si
means well, but, &#8217;tween you and me and the
lamp-post, he ain&#8217;t wuth shucks as a carpenter
and j&#8217;iner&mdash;no, siree! Well, bein&#8217; a cussed
fool, Si misca&#8217;c&#8217;lated somehow, and left &#8217;bout
two-fut space at the forrerd end &#8217;tween the
outside wall and the lath to that side o&#8217; the bedroom.
I s&#8217;posed, o&#8217; course, the old man&#8217;d be
madder&#8217;n a hornet, but he only jest grinned
some, and says to me, says he, it&#8217;ll save that
much floorin&#8217; for the bedroom, yes, I snummy,
he did! Mighty clus, the old man was.&#8221; Jake
paused, and regarded the listeners with merrily
twinkling eyes. &#8220;Might so be as the gold&#8217;s in
thar,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;O&#8217; course, &#8217;tain&#8217;t likely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
but it might so be.&#8221; He stood silent, awaiting
comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re tremendously obliged, Jake,&#8221; Roy
declared promptly; and Saxe added a phrase
of appreciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do we have to tear the house down to get
into the space?&#8221; Roy continued.</p>

<p>Jake shook his head vehemently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit on it,&#8221; he declared; and he forthwith
gave vent to another chuckling series of
explosions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, the old man was clus, as I said.
That&#8217;s right, he was gorrammed clus&mdash;meanin&#8217;
no disrespect. You know that-thar closet in
the front hall upstairs, by the bedroom door.
Well, the old man said they wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no earthly
use o&#8217; wastin&#8217; good timber puttin&#8217; a back to
that closet, with plasterin&#8217; and all. So, he
jest had paper put up. You break away the
paper, and then you can sidle right in&#8217;tween
the outside wall and the lath o&#8217; the bedroom;
thought it might be wuth while jest to look in,
as it were.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, we shall look in,&#8221; Saxe declared,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re tremendously grateful to you, Jake,
for the tip, because we need a lot of help, I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;We appreciate the kindness, old chap,&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;And let me tell you that I&#8217;m going
to show my friendship by getting you a decent
berth, after this wild adventure is over and
done with, where you&#8217;ll have the chance of
your life. Your skill with engines is wasted
here; it&#8217;s &#8217;way off in Cuba, but it&#8217;ll be worth
your while. Would you like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet ye!&#8221; was the sententious answer of
the boatman, as he turned to lead the way
toward the house. Presently, he chuckled yet
once again, contentedly, and added: &#8220;My old
woman allus has been a-pinin&#8217; to travel in
furrin parts.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>IN THE RECESS</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT THE house, no one was visible with
the exception of Billy Walker, who, on
the porch, reclined in a large rocking-chair, displaying
his customary masterly inactivity, the
while he contemplated the tip of a particularly
black cigar, which he had not troubled to light
for the sufficient reason that there were no
matches nearer than the hall. The information
concerning the recess within the walls was
duly imparted to him, and he followed his two
friends and the boatman to the closet in
the hallway upstairs. The others were inclined
to jeer at Billy Walker for this surprising
show of activity on his part. But it was a jibe
from Roy that put the lethargic one on his mettle.
It came after Jake had cut through the
paper in a panel from floor to ceiling, by which
was revealed a black opening into the space
beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, above all,&#8221; Roy said, entreatingly,
&#8220;don&#8217;t, I beg of you, Billy, let your rash impetuosity
lead you to squeezing in here. Remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
your paunch, and be warned in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is certain that, until this moment, Billy
had had no slightest thought of thus venturing
into the opening. But human nature is often
contrary, and, though ordinarily Billy vastly
preferred taunts to physical exertion, in this
instance it so chanced that his friend&#8217;s remark
touched him in a sensitive spot. He said nothing
at the time, however, contenting himself
with a sudden, valiant resolve. So, after candles
had been brought, and his two friends had
squeezed themselves, one after the other into
the opening, Billy Walker, in his turn, essayed
an entrance&mdash;to the considerable astonishment
of Jake, who remained in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better take a candle, sir,&#8221; he suggested;
and he offered one already lighted.</p>

<p>It was accepted, and, holding it high before
him, Billy surveyed the region into which he
meant to venture thus intrepidly. By the flickering
light, he beheld a very narrow passage,
in which, toward the farther end, he could distinguish
the deeper shadow that he knew to be
Roy, who had been the second to enter. There
could be no doubt as to the person&#8217;s identity,
since there was no room in which one person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
could pass another unless by climbing.</p>

<p>At sight of the limited space, Billy was
assailed with pangs of regret that he had so
vaingloriously undertaken the adventure.
Nevertheless, he felt that it was now too late
to retreat, and, with a sigh of disgust, he thrust
himself forward. He had observed in his brief
examination that there was no flooring, but
merely the naked joists, over which he must
make his way very cautiously, stepping accurately
from one to another. Warily, then, he
went forward, using every caution. It was by
no means pleasant going, because of the precarious
footing, and, too, because of the fact
that his broad shoulders were unduly constricted
by the walls on either side. Disaster
came when a nail caught in the sleeve of his
coat, just as he gave a lunge forward. The
unexpected restraint threw him out of balance;
in recovering himself, he dropped the candle.
On the instant, his imagination was filled with
glaring visions of the house in flames.
Alarmed he stooped his heavy body swiftly&mdash;too
swiftly, alas&mdash;for his feet slipped from the
narrow supports. He fell heavily. His hands
and arms shot through the plastering that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
ceiled the room beneath. The violence of the
impact was such that a large square of the
plastering broke away, and went clattering to
the floor of the room below. But, before the
noise of its falling sounded, Billy Walker had
heard another sound, a sharp cry of surprise,
or fear. Through the rain of plaster, his eyes
caught one glimpse of a darting figure; his ears
distinguished from out the other din a scurry
of steps over the polished floor. Even in the
turmoil of the moment, Billy automatically
noted these things. But, at the time, he gave
no heed whatever to them, his one desire just
then was to escape from this horrible predicament
without the loss of an instant. To that
end, he immediately began to back out, with
never another thought to the candle, which,
however, had been extinguished by the fall.</p>

<p>Slowly and wrathfully, Billy Walker made
his laborious retreat on hands and knees backward
from the scene of his exploits. His
friends, startled by the noise behind them, had
managed to face about, and to hurry toward
him, and now they stood, one behind the other,
peering at the prostrate one; at first in amazement
over his presence there at all; then, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
alarm over his condition; finally, reassured, in
hilarious enjoyment of the catastrophe that had
befallen him. Their presence and comments did
not tend to soothe the outraged feelings of the
victim as he wearily crept, retrograde, into the
closet, and at last scrambled to his feet in the
hallway. Jake was so discreet as to say nothing
at all, which reticence gave him a place
for all time in the unhappy man&#8217;s esteem, despite
the fact that the disaster had come from
accepting the proffered candle. The others,
unfortunately, were not so restrained, and
their remarks came near to offending Billy
Walker; certainly, they increased his exasperation
against the event that had made him
ridiculous. But, after a little, he contrived a
diversion:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that plastering didn&#8217;t hurt anybody
when it fell,&#8221; he exclaimed, of a sudden.</p>

<p>Jake shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Thar wa&#8217;n&#8217;t nobody
downstairs, I guess, Marthy&#8217;s out at the back,
lookin&#8217; arter her flower garden, and thar wa&#8217;n&#8217;t
nobody else round when we come up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there was someone in the room downstairs,&#8221;
Billy persisted. &#8220;I heard a cry, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
as my fists went through the plastering, and
then, along with the other noise, I heard the
steps of someone running out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it a man or a woman?&#8221; Roy asked.</p>

<p>Billy shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, I haven&#8217;t the least idea,&#8221; he
answered, &#8220;You see, I was pretty well occupied
at the moment with my own affairs, and
I didn&#8217;t pay a particle of attention to anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I don&#8217;t see that it matters much,&#8221;
Saxe declared. &#8220;It&#8217;s plain that you didn&#8217;t hurt
anyone seriously, or we&#8217;d have heard of it
before this; it didn&#8217;t wound Mrs. Dustin, or
Chris, for here they both come now.&#8221; He
waved his hand toward the stairs, and the
others turned to see the two hurrying up.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dustin was voluble, and mightily
relieved to learn that her precious Jake had
suffered no harm. The mild, black eyes of
Mrs. West&#8217;s servant twinkled with amused
excitement, when he was informed as to the
nature of the happening. They, too, were
puzzled on hearing that someone had been in
the music-room at the time of the accident.</p>

<p>The three friends went down to the porch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
which was still deserted. Billy, who had cast
a disgusted glance on the litter in the drawing-room
in passing, sighed lugubriously, as he
sank back into the rocking-chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more thrilling adventures by field and
flood for me,&#8221; he boomed. &#8220;I have had my
bellyful, all at once. Let the cobbler stick to
his last, and let me stick to my chair. I got
too confoundedly energetic, and I&#8217;m old
enough to know better. I&#8217;ve messed up the
place shockingly, which means so much extra
work for the industrious Mrs. Dustin, whose
amiable, but foolish husband got me into this
idiotic scrape. You would have found that
there was no gold in the place without my
assistance; and, unfortunately, I&#8217;ve incurred a
financial penalty for my misplaced intrusiveness&mdash;into
the plastering&mdash;and when the repairs
of Miss West&#8217;s ceiling shall have been
accomplished, it will be my melancholy duty
to foot the bill. Oh, misery!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others laughed with the unfortunate,
who was now again restored to his usual good
humor. But, presently, Saxe spoke in a
puzzled voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;You really must have been mistaken, Billy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
about having heard someone down below you,
in the music-room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I may possibly be a trifle languorous physically
in some ways on occasion,&#8221; he retorted,
&#8220;but I assure you that my ears are quick
enough. I was not mistaken. I heard just
what I told you I heard, and I saw, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others were unaware that Billy did not
exaggerate the excellent quality of his hearing,
and, in consequence, they found themselves at a
loss. It was Roy, the suspicious, who finally
voiced the idea that was bound to find lodgment
in their minds. When he spoke, it was in
a tone of conviction:</p>

<p>&#8220;The ubiquitous Masters, of course!&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spying again,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;We know that
he&#8217;s capable of it.&#8221; He turned to Billy Walker,
inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The fellow is undoubtedly open to suspicion,
after what you caught him at the other
day.&#8221; Billy admitted. &#8220;Equally of course, we
haven&#8217;t a shred of evidence against him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t matter a bit, as long as we
have the moral certainty,&#8221; Saxe argued. &#8220;But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the real gist of the problem is: What on earth
is the fellow up to, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just pure cussedness,&#8221; Roy asserted, his
face hardening. &#8220;One look at him is enough to
warn anyone that he&#8217;s spoiling for mischief.
He&#8217;s a rotter, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker shook his head, authoritatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, as usual,&#8221; he announced,
with unpleasant frankness. &#8220;As a matter of
fact, our friend, the enemy, has a motive other
than sheer deviltry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others regarded the speaker in surprise,
whereat Billy Walker nodded his head vigorously
a number of times, and looked very wise
indeed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he continued, with much complacency.
&#8220;After you had told me the incident of
his listening to your talk together, I grappled
with the problem of the engineer&#8217;s not minding
his own business, and I presently came on
the obvious solution of the puzzle.&#8221; He
paused, expectantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what was it?&#8221; Roy demanded, impatiently.
He was still smarting a little from
Billy&#8217;s sweeping statement as to his own habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
of inaccuracy. Saxe, too, showed a keen curiosity
in his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The simple truth of the matter is this,&#8221;
the oracle resumed, when he felt that he had
sufficiently whetted their interest by delay.
&#8220;This man, Masters, has a mind to lay hold
on Abernethey&#8217;s treasure himself.&#8221; He
stared triumphantly at first one and then the
other of his hearers.</p>

<p>The effect on them was enough to satisfy
the purveyor of information. Roy fairly
gaped in amazement, while Saxe manifested
first astonishment, then incredulity, which
he voiced baldly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Absurd!&#8221; he cried.</p>

<p>But Billy Walker was prepared to maintain
his contention with arguments, and
forthwith he did so. And, at the last, Billy
made a shrewd suggestion, which, by a
totally different method, arrived at the conclusion
already reached by Roy through his
vaunted sixth sense.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may have wondered a little,&#8221; the
oracle said, &#8220;that I should have made no
particular remonstrance when you incontinently
gave up the search commanded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
immutable logic. Well, as a matter of fact,
I myself would have suggested the uselessness
of further effort along those lines. You
see, the affair lies thus.&#8221; He paused for a
moment, and pursed his lips, as one preparing
for didactic discourse. &#8220;This chap,
Masters, is on terms of considerable
intimacy, I judge, with the girl who was the
secretary of the late Mr. Abernethey. Moreover,
he was here, on the spot. There can
be no question that, sooner or later, he
learned the facts from her concerning the
last will and testament of the eccentric miser.
Thereupon, he determined to go treasure-hunting
on his own account. He was on
the job instanter, so to speak. In fact, I&#8217;m
quite willing to eat my hat, which is an
especially indigestible variety of Stetson, if
the cottage has not already been searched
with great thoroughness by our industrious
antagonist.&#8221; Billy stared at his two friends
contentedly out of his small, dull eyes, and
his heavy face wrinkled into a smile.</p>

<p>The result of his words was all that he
could have desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;The infernal sneak!&#8221; Roy exclaimed, violently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
His eyes grew hard, his mouth set,
with the slight forward push of the jaw. In
Saxe&#8217;s face, too, anger was plain. &#8220;To think
of a nice girl being fooled like that!&#8221; Roy
continued furiously, after an interval of
silence. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll land the robber somehow.
If we don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll find some excuse for
beating him up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind the pummeling,&#8221; Billy
counseled. &#8220;Just you keep your eyes open
that he doesn&#8217;t beat you&mdash;to the money.
For the present, that&#8217;s more important than
jealous rows.&#8221; At this remark, which
showed that the scholar was more observant
than might have been supposed in a field so
foreign to his usual investigations, Roy
blushed for the first time in many years, and
Saxe was so rude as to titter aloud.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that David appeared
from around the north end of the cottage.
Forthwith, he was made familiar with all
that had happened during the period of his
absence, together with the lively suspicions
entertained against the engineer. When
the tale had been told, David took a few
minutes for reflection before he spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to believe anything against
that ornery critter,&#8221; he remarked at last,
with his big eyes twinkling; &#8220;but I am,
before all else, a just man. You&#8217;ve got to
leave Masters out on this last deal. As a
matter of fact, he has a perfectly good alibi;
I wanted a line on the rapscallion, and so I
fairly forced myself on him this morning&mdash;to
his disgust. But he didn&#8217;t think it quite
prudent, I guess, to be out-and-out rude to
me. For the last two hours Masters and I
have been together, strolling chummily over
the hills and far away.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE GOLD SONG</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS MRS. WEST, with Margaret and May
Thurston, had gone for a stroll soon
after the departure of David and the engineer,
the mystery concerning the identity of
the person in the music-room at the time of
Billy&#8217;s misadventure remained unsolved.
The subject afforded the friends much opportunity
for speculation, all of which resulted
in nothing definite. Margaret and her
mother showed not the slightest irritation
over the way in which the property had been
damaged; on the contrary, they were seen
to smile whenever their gaze touched the
broken place in the ceiling, which remained
the mute witness to an inglorious achievement.
Saxe, while awaiting the development
of another idea for the quest, devoted
himself assiduously to Margaret. He made
no effort to conceal his infatuation&mdash;or, if he
did, the attempt was futile. He was, indeed,
so flagrant in his court as to fill the engineer
with an ever increasing fury of jealousy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
threatened ill to one or the other of the two
young men. On his part, Saxe was made
miserable by the affability with which Margaret
accepted the attendance of the engineer
on her. It seemed monstrous that her
instinct should leave her unwarned as to the
vicious character of the fellow. Saxe felt
that he, as a gentleman, could give her no
least word of admonition under the circumstances.
He could only do his best to keep
at her side every moment, and in this he
succeeded remarkably well, though by no
means to the extent of his desire. As for
the disposition of the girl herself, she showed
neutrality between the two men in a manner
that, while equally objectionable to each of
them, must have commanded the admiration
of any unprejudiced observer.</p>

<p>Roy devoted himself with good grace to
May Thurston, who welcomed him candidly,
for her heart was deeply wounded by the
patent defection of her lover. Masters had
glibly assured her that it was the part of
diplomacy just now for him to conceal their
real relation by his attentions to Margaret,
but his reasoning was not altogether convincing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
to her intelligence, and the voice of
instinct told her that her love was being
flouted before her very eyes. In consequence,
she greeted this new admirer gladly as a sop
to her pride and, presently, as Roy exerted
himself to the utmost toward making a favorable
impression, for the sake of the genuine
pleasure his company gave her. Being a
sensible young woman in the main, the
inevitable comparisons that soon began to
arise in her mind between the two young
men did much toward tearing loose the roots
of love from her heart, leaving the soil there
freshly tilled for the planting of other seed.</p>

<p>Mrs. West played her part excellently as
chaperon by giving her society much of the
time to David and Billy. She was so good
to look on in her well-preserved charms, and
so wise and sympathetic in her conversation,
and so untiring a listener, that the two men
found themselves very content.</p>

<p>The other three members of the household,
Jake, his wife, and Chris made an
amiable trio in the kitchen, where Mrs. Dustin,
who, as Jake bore witness, had always
&#8220;hankered to go a-travelin&#8217;,&#8221; was never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
weary of hearing the newcomer&#8217;s tales of
strange places whither he had journeyed.
For the first time in his life, Chris found himself
appreciated at his full worth, perhaps
beyond, not as a servant but as a man, by
those who, while of a humble walk in life,
were yet not of the servant class. He
expanded under the novel and pleasing influence,
and developed a gift of narrative that
surprised himself. He felt a new sense of his
own importance, which did not in the least
lessen his devotion to Mrs. West and Margaret.</p>

<p>On the third night after the episode in
the recess, the ladies had retired to their
chambers for the night, and the indefatigable
Masters, also, had taken his departure from
the cottage, but the four friends still
remained in the music-room, where Saxe had
been playing. They were smoking and chatting
in care-free fashion of many things&mdash;but
not of the treasure which they had set
out to find, though that lay ready at the back
of the mind of each.</p>

<p>Saxe lingered at the piano. Now, he was
idly giving forth bits of various compositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
as they chanced to rise in memory. It was
while in this mood of desultory reminiscence
that he suddenly became aroused to knowledge
of the fact that he was monotonously
drumming a tedious strain, which had
neither melody or harmony to justify the
choice of it at all, much less this senseless
reiteration. For a few seconds, he found
himself bewildered: he could not recall what
the music was, either the name of the composition
or the name of the author. Nor
could he recollect what manner of association
he had ever had with the barren phrases,
that he should thus subconsciously carry
them in memory. He was disagreeably
impressed by the event, because he prided
himself on the clarity of his mental processes,
and here he found himself completely
baffled. Then, in a flash, remembrance came,
and with it an even greater wonder.</p>

<p>This was the music that had been written
by the old man of whom he was the doubtful
heir. Even while he mused, he had been continuing
the harsh fragment, and now he gave
careful ear to it, seeking some explanation of
the reason why it had persisted in memory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
to issue in his playing without volition on
his part. But there came no suggestion as
to that cause from the uncouth strain. He
played it once again, without any hint of
understanding, then ceased, wholly at a loss;
it was another who afforded the clue that
had eluded him.</p>

<p>As the echoes died away, Billy Walker
rumbled a comment from his luxurious huddling
in the depths of the chair:</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like money&mdash;heaps of money&mdash;gold,
you know, all in stacks, being counted&mdash;clink,
clink! Clink, clink!&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe whirled on the piano-stool, an expression
of amazement on his face as he stared
at his unmusical friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;By heavens, Billy,&#8221; he cried excitedly,
&#8220;you&#8217;ve got it&mdash;you&#8217;ve got it exactly! That&#8217;s
what it is; it&#8217;s the clink, clink, clink of the
gold-pieces, as they&#8217;re piled up.&#8221; He was
astounded by this perspicacity on the part of
one who had no soul for music, yet had succeeded
here, where he himself had failed.
He had no particle of doubt that this explanation
as to the meaning of the music was
the true one. He played the piece once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
again, emphasizing the accent in the bass a
little, so that the effect was even more pronounced.
There could be no mistake.</p>

<p>Roy spoke with sudden appreciation of the
fact:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s the piece you played the
other night&mdash;the weird one. I&#8217;d been wondering
where I&#8217;d heard it. It&#8217;s the one that
got on Miss Thurston&#8217;s nerves so, because
the old man was always playing it toward
the last. It&#8217;s enough to get on anyone&#8217;s
nerves, for that matter, but Billy hit the idea
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>David Thwing, nodding energetically,
turned his protuberant eyes on Billy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you hit it, old man,&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;You got the idea we were all looking for,
and couldn&#8217;t quite catch hold of. Bully for
you! But how in the world did you ever
come to do it? You, a music sharp!&#8221; He
burst into a mellow peal of laughter, in which
the others joined.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Saxe sprang to his feet, with a
display of emotion that was contrary to his
habit, for he had schooled himself to a certain
phlegmatic bearing that masked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
native susceptibility of his moods. Now,
however, he forgot restraint in the agitation
of his feeling, and addressed his friends with
a vehemence that astonished them. His
swift gestures and the changing play of his
features revealed the volatile artistic temperament,
which was ordinarily shrouded
within a veil of imperturbable calm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, I understand it all now,&#8221; he
declared eagerly. &#8220;In this music, the old
man crystallized his besetting sin. This
composition of his is the song of gold; it
is the miser&#8217;s song. In it, he translates into
musical terms the vice that corroded his soul.
In it, he expresses the sordidness of that vice,
even as he himself knew it out of dreadful
personal experience. And, somehow, he put
into the music the strength of the spell that
was laid on him. It is there&mdash;some malignant
fascination which each and every one
of us has felt in a fashion of his own. That
is why it so gripped Miss Thurston, and why
it affected her so disagreeably. It has in it
a subtle, irresistible suggestion of the hideous.
The ignominy and the power of greed
alike sound in the monotony of its rhythm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
its harshness, its fearful simplicity. It is
uncouth, it is as if it were calloused. Yet,
it is full of vital, frightful emotion. It is a
statement of ghastly truth, it is a confession
of degradation, it is a wail of utter despair.
In short, it is the heart-song of the miser,
written by the brain that looked into the
heart and learned its hateful mystery.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others had listened in tense silence,
surprised beyond measure before this outbreak
from one always hitherto so tranquil,
so serene amid the varying stresses of affairs.
It was the revelation of their friend in a new
light, wherein he showed with an impressiveness
strange to them. They watched
him intently as he stood there before them,
all animation, his handsome face flushed in
the passion of the moment. A little sigh of
appreciation issued from the lips of each as,
with the last words, he sank again to the
piano-stool, and dropped his hands to the
keys. So, once again, he played the music
of that dead man who had given himself to
a gross, an evil worship. Still under the
influence of deep emotion, the player now
abandoned himself to the theme, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
wrought on it with all his skill in music, with
all the feeling of repulsion that held him in
thrall.</p>

<p>There was not in this improvisation the
power, the mastery, that had marked the
frenzied interpretation by which the composer
had amazed the night. But Saxe Temple
was not wanting a large measure of skill, and
to this he added the sympathy of the true
artist, surcharged with a profound emotion.
The uncanny spell of the music laid its hold on
them all as he went on playing, gripped them,
sent weird visions reeling before their fancy.
Even Billy Walker for once was beguiled into
a curious receptivity, so that he saw vistas of
crouched specters, which ceaselessly shuffled
golden coins to and fro, in a frenetic joy
that was the madness of anguish. May
Thurston, asleep in her chamber, turned
uneasily, and her dreams grew troubled.</p>

<p>When, at last, Saxe had made an end of
playing, there followed a long silence. It was
Billy Walker who broke it. His great voice
rang through the room, harsh, compelling:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s there,&#8221; he said, with simple finality.
&#8220;It&#8217;s there&mdash;the clue!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />

<small>IN THE WOOD</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE others received the astonishing pronouncement
of Billy Walker with varying
emotions, of which the chief was a candid
incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;How in the world do you justify that
remarkable statement?&#8221; Roy demanded,
breaking the silence of surprise, which had
at first held the three.</p>

<p>For a moment, Billy showed traces of
embarrassment. Then, swiftly, an expression
of relief showed on his heavy face, and
he spoke glibly enough:</p>

<p>&#8220;The conclusion to which I have come,&#8221; he
declared ponderously, &#8220;is compelled by exact
reasoning from all the facts in our possession.
The late Mr. Abernethey unquestionably
left for his heir some sort of clue as to
the hiding-place of the money. Having in
mind the whimsical nature of the man, we
may well believe that, in a case such as this,
the clue would be of an especially curious
kind. Next, we have the fact that Mr. Abernethey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was a musician. He was devoted to
that art beyond anything else, excepting
only his passion as a miser. Now, our search
through his effects and his house has discovered
only a single thing having a real,
vital bearing on his personality, and&mdash;more
than that&mdash;on the very object of our quest
here, money. In consequence of all these
facts, I am led to the conclusion that this
page of manuscript offers us the clue for
which we have hitherto been hunting in
vain.&#8221; The speaker paused, to stare from
one to another of his auditors triumphantly.</p>

<p>Roy uttered an ejaculation of impatience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reason is a good thing sometimes, and
sometimes it isn&#8217;t. This, I&#8217;m thinking, is
one of the times when it isn&#8217;t. The trouble
with your whole argument, Billy, lies in an
additional fact; that a sheet of music can&#8217;t
tell you where a certain hole in the ground
may chance to be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Billy&#8217;s question came tartly.</p>

<p>Roy replied with a hint of disdain in his
voice, such as is often characteristic of the
musical person in speaking of his art to one
unlearned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>&#8220;The reason would be obvious to you, if
you knew anything of music,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, it&#8217;s lucky I don&#8217;t,&#8221; was the other&#8217;s
retort; &#8220;because, in some way that we don&#8217;t
know yet, the clue we need is set down on
that manuscript. It is logically certain, and,
if you musical sharps can&#8217;t guess as much,
it&#8217;s fortunate I&#8217;m along to give you the
pointer.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, also, expressed himself as skeptical
of the announcement made by Billy:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it had been anybody except Billy who
had been hit by this idea, I should feel quite
differently about it,&#8221; he asserted, chuckling
in response to the glare of indignation with
which the oracle received the words. &#8220;Of
course, you know my feeling in the matter.
I&#8217;m expecting some sort of inspiration to hit
us; I have been, ever since Roy had his
hunch. But Billy isn&#8217;t of the sensitive temperament,
which is receptive to impressions
of a psychic sort. If Roy had received this
idea, without a bit of reason to back it up, I
should have had high hopes&mdash;or if it had
come to Saxe even, because he has the sensitiveness
of the artistic temperament.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>&#8220;Or even if it had come to your delicately
susceptible self, I suppose,&#8221; Billy suggested,
acrimoniously.</p>

<p>David nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all humility, yes,&#8221; he answered,
unabashed. &#8220;And you needn&#8217;t be peevish,
Billy, for the simple reason that you&#8217;d be
furious if anyone were to accuse you of being
a psychic subject. Eh, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy growled assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That sort of thing&#8217;s all rot,&#8221; he affirmed,
with emphasis. &#8220;I arrived at the fact easily
and sanely by the exercise of a rationalizing
intelligence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Precisely!&#8221; David agreed. &#8220;And that&#8217;s
why I don&#8217;t attach the slightest importance
to your statement.&#8221; At this heterodox confession,
Billy was too overwhelmed with disgust
to pursue the argument farther.</p>

<p>Saxe did not share in the avowed disbelief
of Roy and David. While the others were
engaged in disputation, he had gone to the
stack of music, and had looked through it
until he came upon the sheet of manuscript.
Then, he returned to his seat on the stool,
placed the music on the rack, and devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
himself to scrutiny of the writing. He felt,
somehow, that he dared not reject the suggestion
that here was the very thing he
sought as the guide to fortune. Nevertheless,
though he studied the page with anxious
intensity, he could perceive no possibility of
any hint to be derived from the simple score
of notes. There was nothing set down in
the way of diagram, or combination of letters
which by twist of ingenuity might be
made to suit his need. Nothing showed
beyond the phrases of a composition naked
in its simplicity. Reason told him that any
trust in this manuscript were delusion. Yet,
he hung over it, absorbed, even while he
chided himself for his interest in a thing
plainly worthless to the purpose.</p>

<p>It was Billy Walker, turning in disgust
from the debate with David, who first
observed Saxe&#8217;s absorption in the manuscript,
and his vanity was at once consoled
by this mute support. He got up lumberingly,
and crossed over to the piano, where
he stood looking down at the music. His
action caused David and Roy to perceive
what Saxe was doing, and forthwith, despite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
their skepticism, they, too, rose and went to
the piano, there to stare down curiously at
the manuscript on the rack.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of the sheet on which the
four adventurers were looking down:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="center">[<a href="music/lake_mystery_music.midi">Listen</a>]</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>The four stood in silence for a long minute,
gazing down at the manuscript page with
keen discouragement. Saxe was the first to
speak, shaking his head dispiritedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;It means nothing,&#8221; he said, with melancholy
certainty in his voice. &#8220;There is no
possibility of its meaning anything. For a
moment, I was foolish enough to hope that
Billy had really got the right idea, but he
hasn&#8217;t. This is a plain bit of music, nothing
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Roy agreed, with a contemptuous
inflection. &#8220;My personal opinion is
that the power of ratiocination is not always
what it&#8217;s cracked up to be, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>David, once again, shared the general disbelief.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;the idea won&#8217;t hold
water. There is no way to convey meaning
by the score of a musical composition except
the emotion that the author has experienced
himself, and wishes thus to interpret to his
hearers. The old man meant in this case to
tell us of the spell that the love of gold lays
on the miser. He has done that. Billy was
the one who called our attention to the fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
He must be content with that much glory.
His other idea was just poppycock.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker was unconvinced.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about music,&#8221; he conceded.
&#8220;But I have the God-given gift of
reason, which is not vouchsafed to the brutes&mdash;or
to all human beings, I regret to say.
Reason convinces me that the clue lies somewhere
on this sheet. I reaffirm my conclusion.
Since I know nothing of music, the
remainder of the work must be done by you.
It has now become your responsibility. I
have done my part.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dignity and the earnestness with
which this declaration was made impressed
the doubters in spite of themselves. When
Billy had ceased speaking, they remained
silent, vaguely hesitant, though quite unconvinced.
Saxe, perhaps, more than either of
the others was desirous of accepting Billy&#8217;s
idea as true, but he was unable to justify
it by anything tangible. His was, after all,
the chief interest in the issue, and he was
eager to seize on even the most meager possibility
that offered hope of success. So now,
he was anxious to believe, and racked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
brain to find some character of subtle significance
on the page before him. It was in
vain. He could discern nothing beyond the
obvious meaning of the score as the symbol
of a musical composition.</p>

<p>Thus the matter remained for a week.
Billy Walker retained certainty as to the correctness
of his judgment; David and Roy
maintained their attitude of skepticism; Saxe
continued his mood of willingness to believe,
along with a total incapacity to find an atom
of evidence in support of it. He sat for hours
before the manuscript, hoping for some
inspiration to come, but his thoughts
remained barren. He realized, with poignant
regret, that time was slipping away on
swiftest wings, yet he felt himself powerless
before the problem, on the solving of which
his fortune was conditioned.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not all his time was given to
the quest. A part, even the greater part,
was bestowed on Margaret West&mdash;on her
in person, when opportunity served, on her
in thought, when absent from her. His
failure to make any progress in the search
for the treasure would without doubt have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
caused him vastly more distress of mind, had
it not been for the fact that most of his
energy was devoted to the girl. Worry over
money could not affect him to desperation,
when he was constantly titillating over the
secret of a maiden&#8217;s heart. He was assiduous
in his attentions, but he could not win
from Margaret any sure indication of preference.
She was as amiable as the most exacting
lover might require, but she displayed
none of that coyness or confusion for which
Saxe looked as a sign that her heart was
engaged. He did not dare over-much, for
the brief length of their acquaintance seemed
to forbid. But this restraint caused him torment
on account of jealousy, since Masters
appeared soon as an open rival in the wooing
of the girl. Margaret&#8217;s treatment of the
engineer was of such a sort that it drove
Saxe nearly to desperation. She was unfailingly
as amiable to the one as to the other of
her suitors. It was, to Saxe, utterly inconceivable
that any woman could be guilty of
such folly as to love a man like the engineer,
yet the girl&#8217;s attitude toward Masters filled
him with alarm, so that he pressed his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
suit with more insistence, and came to hate
his adversary exceedingly.</p>

<p>Masters, too, suffered under the curse of
jealousy. His love for Margaret was a sincere
passion, and the hate Saxe bore for him
he returned in overflowing measure.
Through all his emotion of love, however,
there remained in undiminished vigor his
desire to possess himself of the gold hidden
by Abernethey. And, presently, there grew
in him a desperate resolve, brought into
being in part by greed, in part by hatred of
his rival.</p>

<p>May Thurston was another in the throes
of anguish, and that from no fault of her
own. Her love for the engineer had involved
her in almost unendurable humiliation. His
ostentatious worship of Margaret West at
first filled May with the agony of outraged
affection, then forced her to the wrath of
revolt against such treachery. This mood
endured. The little hypocrisies of loving,
which Masters attempted on the rare occasions
when the two were alone together, did
not deceive her in the least. Yet, the final
break between the two was delayed for lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of courage on her part to accuse him openly
of his guilt. The matter stood thus between
them when, one morning after a sleepless
night, May got from her bed before sunrise,
dressed herself hurriedly, and left the cottage,
hoping that the freshness of the dawn
might serve to soothe her wearied nerves.
She wandered aimlessly hither and yon
through the woods bordering the shore, and
did indeed win some solace for her soul in
the radiance of the summer day. She was
about fifty yards distant from the cottage,
descending the slope that ran to the shore,
when she heard a slight noise among the
bushes in front of her. She halted instantly,
curious to know what manner of creature
might be at hand, and welcoming any distraction
from the distress in her heart.</p>

<p>Herself hidden by a screen of foliage, she
peered forth cautiously, searching with her
eyes the thicket beyond. At first, she could
distinguish nothing, and, after a little,
became convinced that she had been deceived
by the dropping of a rotted branch. She was
on the point of advancing again, when
another and louder sound arrested her. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
issued from a place somewhat farther to the
right than that she had scrutinized, and now,
as she watched intently, she made out the
dim form of some object moving slowly
within a clump of high bushes, from the
center of which grew a thick-leafed sapling.
Another minute of inspection convinced her
that the object was a man, and immediately
an intuition bore upon her that it was
Masters himself. Sure of his identity, she
went forward quickly, following the impulse
of the moment, and called him by name.</p>

<p>Masters&mdash;for it was in truth the engineer&mdash;whirled
and faced the girl with an expression
of terror, which, however, vanished so
swiftly that May afterward found herself
wondering if in fact she had not merely
imagined it. Moreover, he smiled on her
with more tenderness than he had exhibited
in his manner for days, and his voice, when
he spoke, was caressing:</p>

<p>&#8220;You, May!&#8221; he cried. His tones indicated
a joyous surprise over the unexpected meeting.
&#8220;You, too, are rivaling the lark this
morning, like myself. I woke up three hours
ago, and, when I found there was no chance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
to get to sleep again, I decided to commune
with nature. I&#8217;ve been trailing a wonderful
moth, but I&#8217;ve lost it at last, I&#8217;m sorry to
say. It was a beauty!&#8221; He paused from the
flow of words, which had been perhaps a
trifle too rapid for entire sincerity, and
regarded the girl with a glance that was at
once fond and quizzical. &#8220;And did you, too,
have a touch of insomnia?&#8221; he inquired.</p>

<p>May nodded, rather listlessly. For some
reason that she could not understand, she
was not convinced by the specious suavity of
the engineer&#8217;s utterance. At the back of her
mind was a belief that the man was lying,
though she refused to allow the accusation
place. Her instinct revolted against the disloyalty
of the fellow. Nevertheless, her
heart was moved to a last struggle in behalf
of the love to which she had once so joyously
surrendered herself. She determined on an
appeal to that better nature which she
believed the engineer to possess:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hartley,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;I wish you to
do something for me&mdash;no, for yourself. I
want you to give up this mad idea of securing
the gold Mr. Abernethey hid.&#8221; The gaze<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of her dark eyes was full of affectionate
pleading.</p>

<p>The reply of Masters was prompt, without
any least trace of hesitancy. He put out his
hand, and took hers, pressing it tenderly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; he said softly, &#8220;you have been
right, and I have been wrong. I see it now.
I was carried away for a little while by my
longing for money. I wanted it for you,
not for myself altogether&mdash;you must know
that. Now, I have repented. It was my conscience
that kept me awake last night. I
have already abandoned the idea of trying
to get hold of a fortune that doesn&#8217;t rightly
belong to me. Can you forgive me, dearest?
I&#8217;ve been a little mad, I think.&#8221; He paused,
and, in the silence that followed, drew her to
him, and kissed her very gently on the forehead.</p>

<p>May accepted the embrace&mdash;knew not,
indeed, how to refuse it, although it failed
to thrill her with that rapture which she
had once known in his arms. Instead, she
sighed in a confusion of emotions, which she
herself was far from understanding. As a
matter of fact, however, this was the beginning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of the end. At last, under the stress of
doubt inflicted persistently on her higher
nature, the physical attraction exerted by
Masters, which, unknown to her, had been
the impelling cause for the activity of her
imagination in making him an ideal, this
potency of sex charm was overwhelmed
by the essential antagonism between
her soul and his. A certain shyness
held her mute, so that Masters was well
content with the effect he had secured; but,
in this, his self-confidence and the seeming
passivity of the girl led him far astray. In
truth, May felt assured that Masters lied,
and the failure of personal contact to yield
any emotion save an actual dissatisfaction
set the instinctive disbelief in bold relief.
When, soon afterward, they separated, May
was secretly aware that her first romance
had come to an inglorious end.</p>

<small>THE SHOT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS in the evening of this same day, at
dinner, that the element of tragedy was
first injected into the situation. In addition
to Mrs. West and her daughter, May Thurston,
and the four young men, there was present
Hartley Masters. He had been invited frequently
to dine at the cottage, and had for a
time accepted every invitation. Latterly, however,
the evidences of strained feeling between
him and the other men had become so pronounced
that he had usually offered some excuse
for declining the kindly hospitality of
Mrs. West. Another reason that influenced
him in this was his own lack of confidence in
his self-control, since the incident at the boat-house,
which he had had some difficulty in
explaining satisfactorily to May. Nevertheless,
tonight, he had chosen to rely on his powers
of self-restraint, and had accepted at once
when Mrs. West suggested his remaining for
the evening meal.</p>

<p>The construction of the cottage was such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that the dining-room was at the back of the
house. On the left, as one entered the hall,
was the large music-room, which occupied the
entire ground floor of the added wing. On
the right, the first room was that which had
served Abernethey as an office. Beyond this
came the dining-room, with one window at the
back, and one on the north side. Mrs. West
sat at the head of the table, in such a position
that she faced the window to the north.
Margaret sat opposite her, while Saxe was
placed at her right hand. Beyond him was
May Thurston, and beyond her Roy. Billy
Walker was beside the hostess on the left, and
then David Thwing, while Masters filled the
place next to Margaret.</p>

<p>The conversation at the table went pleasantly
enough, despite the latent hostility between
the engineer and the other men. The antipathy
of Saxe and his friends was certainly not
shared by either Margaret or her mother,
unless they concealed their feeling with much
skill, for the daughter addressed herself to
Masters much of the time, and Mrs. West
often included him in the conversation. By
tacit agreement the subject of the miser&#8217;s gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
was not touched on by anyone, and the desultory
talk ran the usual gamut of art, literature,
the drama, and those innumerable topics that
serve as the transient vehicles for individual
wit and seriousness.</p>

<p>It chanced that a decanter stood on the table,
close to the edge, just by Billy Walker&#8217;s right
elbow. As he turned to address David on his
left, his right arm was moved carelessly, and
the decanter was jolted from its place. It
poised for a second, balanced on its bottom
edge, then fell over the side of the table toward
the floor. But the time, brief as it was, had
been sufficient for action on the part of Saxe.
Naturally of exceeding rapidity of movement,
although he held this under restraint ordinarily,
so that he appeared rather languid than
otherwise, an instantaneous responsiveness of
his body to any command of the will had been
cultivated by the years of exercise at the piano.
So, now, on the instant when he perceived the
touch of Billy&#8217;s elbow to the decanter, he
darted in a single step from his seat to a position
behind Mrs. West&#8217;s chair with arm outstretched,
and in the same second, his nimble
fingers had closed on the neck of the falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
decanter, to which they clung tenaciously. Before
he could again straighten himself, there
came a thud against the east wall of the dining-room&mdash;with
it the sharp crack of a rifle, fired
from close at hand.</p>

<p>Saxe stood erect&mdash;stared dumbfounded at
the others. They stared back at him, wordless
for the moment, stupefied. Each looked at first
one and then another, unable to surmise as to
what had come upon them. It was Masters
who finally broke the oppressive silence. The
engineer&#8217;s face was of a dead white, and as he
spoke he tugged nervously at the luxuriant
mustache:</p>

<p>&#8220;Some hunter&#8217;s been mighty careless,&#8221; he
declared; and he smiled, rather feebly, on Margaret,
who had looked up at the sound of his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;He sure was some careless,&#8221; agreed David
who, at times, relapsed into an early dialect.
&#8220;Shootin&#8217; promiscuous-like!&#8221; He goggled at
the startled company through his thick lenses.</p>

<p>Forthwith, a babel broke forth, a confusion
of exclamations, in which were voiced alarm,
wonder and anger. It was Saxe, still on his
feet, who first bethought himself of the thud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
heard from the direction of the east wall. At
once, he went to the sideboard, which was
against the wall on that side. Only a brief
search was necessary to reveal the hole which
the bullet had pierced in the top drawer of the
sideboard. Saxe uttered an ejaculation that
brought the others crowding about him. He
exhibited the opening left by the bullet&#8217;s passing,
then pulled out the drawer, and found the
missile itself imbedded in the back. Roy and
David, who had become familiar with deadly
weapons on the frontier of the Northland, dug
out the bullet, and immediately proceeded to
learned discourse anent its character and the
caliber of the rifle from which it had been sent.
Billy Walker took no interest in this discussion,
and, having stood on his feet for a longer time
than was his custom, returned to his seat at the
table, where he disposed himself with a sigh of
relief. The ladies, too, went back to their
places, but Saxe, David and Roy, with Masters,
ran out of the cottage to search for the
person who had fired the shot. From the
place in which the bullet had lodged, it was
evident that the rifle had been fired from some
point on the ridge back of the cottage, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
up this the four took their way, scattering as
they went to cover a line of considerable
length. They made a pretty thorough examination,
but came on nothing to indicate who
the culprit might have been. The underbrush
was thick along the slope, yet the range of
space shown by the direction of the bullet was
so small that they were enabled to beat the
coverts with completeness. In the end, it was
the general agreement that some hunter had
fired at a squirrel on the slope, probably in
ignorance that a dwelling lay beyond the screen
of foliage. Afterward, he had gone on his
way, without any realization of possible peril
from the shot.</p>

<p>The dusk was falling ere they abandoned
the hunt, and started on their return to the
house. It was just before they reached the
cottage that David, who was blest with more
humor than are most, threw back his head,
and laughed long and heartily with the mellow
peals that made those who heard him usually
laugh for sheer sympathy before inquiring the
cause of his mirth. At the sound, Saxe and
Roy smiled expectantly; but Masters only
looked on curiously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of comedy in this near-tragedy,&#8221;
David explained, after he had put a
period to his merriment. &#8220;When you get back
to the house, Saxe old man,&#8221; he went on, more
seriously, &#8220;it&#8217;s up to you to get down on your
marrow-bones, and say, &#8216;Thank you!&#8217; to your
indolent friend, Billy Walker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Saxe demanded, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;For the simple reason that he came all-fired
close to saving your life. In fact, I haven&#8217;t
any doubt that he actually did save it. If not
that, he saved you from a nasty wound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand yet,&#8221; Saxe said, perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just this,&#8221; David explained. &#8220;From
the location of the bullet in the sideboard, I&#8217;m
strongly of the opinion that you were exactly in
the line of it, so that, if you had been sitting in
your place at the table, you would have had it
clean through the chest. You jumped to catch
the decanter Billy knocked off the table with his
elbow. That movement on your part saved you.
It was Billy&#8217;s awkwardness that caused your
action; so it&#8217;s up to you to thank him for saving
your life. And, as a matter of fact, though I
laughed, it&#8217;s not exactly a subject for mirth.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>Saxe&#8217;s expression had grown very grave as
he listened. There comes always to the normal
man a shock on realizing the imminence of
death for himself. The fact that the peril is
past alters the nature of the shock, but it
hardly lessens it. So, in the present instance,
the young man, whose great risk was thus suddenly
brought home to him, felt the thrill of
deep emotion, in which thankfulness for the
fate that had intervened in his behalf was
strong. He said nothing for a few moments,
nor did Roy, who, in his turn, was affected as
he understood the danger that had menaced his
friend. Masters uttered an ejaculation, which
was indeterminate as to meaning.</p>

<p>They found the others still in the dining-room,
and immediately learned that Billy
Walker was quite willing to sacrifice his modesty
on the altar of fact; for he greeted their
return with a roaring statement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Saxe, my boy, I saved your life, and I hope
you&#8217;ll do me credit. From a study of the range
of the trajectory of the bullet, I have learned
that, had you been in your place at the table,
the bullet would have penetrated your breast
at a vital point. My clumsiness was the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
cause of your escape&mdash;examine for yourself.&#8221;
He waved a hand toward the sideboard.</p>

<p>Saxe, his face still grave, nodded assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;I appreciate it, Billy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll not
forget it, you may be sure. Dave, too, thought
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, no thanks to me,&#8221; Billy declared,
embarrassed by the emotion in his friend&#8217;s
voice. &#8220;It was only by accident that I interfered&mdash;not
by volition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; Saxe agreed. &#8220;But the fact
remains that you were the instrument of salvation,
and that is what I shall always remember.&#8221;
He looked toward Margaret West as he
spoke, and saw that her face was very pale.
He wondered how much of that pallor&mdash;if
indeed any of it&mdash;had been caused by his own
peril. For a fleeting second, the girl&#8217;s limpid
blue eyes met his, then they were veiled by the
thick lashes. He found himself unable to read
the meaning that had lain in them. He went
to his chair, seated himself, and afterward
twisted about to mark the precise line in which
the bullet had passed. There could be no manner
of doubt: its course had been such that he
could have escaped only by a miracle, had he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
been in his place. There could have been only
a slight variation in the direction of the bullet,
dependent on the position of the marksman.
That variation could by no means have been
great enough to save him from a grave, probably
a mortal, wound. Saxe shuddered, as the
narrowness of his escape was again, and thus
visibly, borne in on his consciousness. He
looked about the cheery room and into the
faces of the others with a sort of wonder in
the realization that he was still of the quick,
not of the dead. The wine of life took on new
flavor. His gaze went again to Margaret.</p>

<p>All went into the music-room presently, still
talking of the event that had been so close to
tragedy&mdash;all except May Thurston. Without
attracting any attention, she quietly slipped
away from the others into the out-of-doors.</p>

<p>There are times when one finds it well-nigh
impossible to analyze the workings of the mind,
and it was so with this girl tonight. Suspicion
had come to her&mdash;suspicion sudden, terrible,
irresistible, and she knew not whence it
came. She fought against it in an effort of
reason, but she fought in vain. She could not
flee its clutch, strive as she would. In the end,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
she made abject surrender, and fled forth into
the night, to learn whether suspicion taught
her truth or a lie.</p>

<p>May Thurston was a girl of much more than
average intelligence. Native shrewdness had
been sharpened by years of association with
men of ability, to whom her secretarial skill
had made her valuable. She had drawn from
them something besides her weekly stipend:
she had assimilated a faculty for logical deductions
made with lightning swiftness, which is
not characteristic of women, and is rare among
men. Often, in fact, its possessor confuses it
with intuition, because the rapidity of such
automatic reasoning is so great that its method
readily escapes the attention of the one using
it. In the present instance, the girl in her distress
was totally unconscious of the fact that
she had reasoned with exactness from a group
of circumstances within her knowledge. Yet,
this was the case, and to such reasoning, doubtless,
rather than to intuition, was the strength
of her suspicion due. Intuitive perception she
had to the full, and to it, it is likely, she owed
some measure of the belief that now obsessed
her, but its origin had been in the reasoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
power alone, which she had exercised involuntarily,
even unconsciously.</p>

<p>The first fact on which she builded had been
the expression of terror on Masters&#8217; face,
when she chanced upon him in the wood at
dawn. Now, she could no longer believe that
fancy had played a trick on her. On the contrary,
she was sure of the emotion he had
shown, and, too, sure of the sinister significance
of it. It meant guilt. Masters was not
a timid girl, to be filled with fright at the
unheralded coming of another in the forest.
She believed, rather, that he possessed an
abundance of physical courage, whatever his
lack of the moral. Nevertheless, at her call, he
had shown abject fear. The signs of it had
vanished in the twinkling of an eye; but they
had been present for an appreciable length of
time. Since there could have been nothing else
to cause him alarm in that place, this must have
been the fear of discovery, which only guilt
could explain. What that guilt might be, it
were easy to guess, if one took thought of the
event that had so recently befallen, where death
had been avoided by the merest hazard of fate.
May did not formulate her reasoning in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
wise, but this was the nature of it. From it,
she drew the conclusion that drove her forth
alone into the night. As she went her way up
the slope, intuition whispered that the hideous
suspicion was truth.</p>

<p>The moon was just thrusting its bulk of gold
over the wooded ranges of the eastern shore,
and its radiance flooded the ascent, up which
she mounted with a step that was unfaltering,
though the heart was sick within her. She
could see very clearly, and guided her course
without hesitation toward the point at which
she had encountered the engineer.</p>

<p>When she reached the bit of underbrush in
which she had stopped short on first hearing
Masters, May peered through the purple dusk,
and readily made out the outline of the sapling
beneath which the engineer had stood
when she accosted him. She at once made her
way quickly to a position immediately below
its canopy of branches. It was well foliaged,
yet not so thickly as to prevent her from observing
freely. If, at this moment, anyone
had asked her what she expected to find there
aloft, she would have been utterly unable to
make a coherent explanation, and indeed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
must have been instinct, rather than reason,
that now guided her in the search, for, without
understanding in the least why she did so, she
stared up into the branches with fixed intensity,
her heart beating like the sound of battle-drums
in her ears. Presently, then, her gaze
fastened on a line of shadow, high among the
branches, and on this she held her attention
concentrated, though there seemed nothing in
the appearance to justify an absorption so complete.
It was, perhaps, instinct again that
caused her to feel the importance of this variation
from the green black of the foliage.
Whether that, or the leaping processes of reason,
she was impelled to search out the meaning
of the shadow aloft among the branches.
She laid hold of the lower branches, and easily
swung up into the tree.</p>

<p>May mounted swiftly until the shadow was
within reach of her hand. Yet she could not
distinguish it clearly on account of a branch,
which held a screen of leaves between it and
the moon. Putting out her hand, she bent the
bough aside, so that the light shone on the
thing that had drawn her to the spot. She saw
a rifle!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>The weapon had been fastened to the trunk
of the sapling, at a point where one of the
larger branches made a fork. The stock had
been secured in a position that permitted easy
adjustment, by means of two ropes, which ran
to other branches, so placed that tightening
cords would vary the mark toward which the
rifle was aimed. Masters, from his technical
skill as an engineer, would have found little
difficulty in making the arrangement to his satisfaction.
May realized at a glance that there
could be no doubt as to the actuality. Hartley
Masters had deliberately attempted to murder
Saxe Temple. A wave of loathing swept over
her as she grasped this final confirmation of
the hideous thing she had suspected. In the
flood of abhorrence for the crime, the last
remnants of her love were overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Only one thing baffled her in the understanding
of the event. She saw clearly that, the position
of the seats in the dining-room being
familiar to the engineer, it had been simplicity
itself for him so to dispose the rifle in the tree
as to have it trained on the spot occupied by
Temple&#8217;s breast as the unsuspecting victim sat
at table. It was hardly likely, moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
that any other would be exposed to peril, since
the smallness of the room was such that there
was not sufficient space between sideboard and
chairs on that side of the table for Mrs. Dustin
to pass in her service of the meals. The
deliberate malignity of the plot was appalling
to May, as she considered this naked revelation
of it. She was pallid, shuddering, nauseated.</p>

<p>The one thing that puzzled her for a time
was the means by which the criminal had
been able to secure the discharge of the rifle
in his absence. It was plain that he had
devised some method, so that he himself should
be above suspicion, in the possession of a perfect
alibi. It would, of course, be absurd for
anyone to bring an accusation against him,
when it was the common knowledge of all that
he had been seated at the very table with the
one against whom the attempt had been made.
Yet, she failed to penetrate the method employed
by him in firing the piece, and for a long
time she puzzled over this in vain.</p>

<p>Then, at last, her eyes were caught by a
fragment of cord, which hung from the trigger
of the rifle. A brief examination showed
her that the loose end was charred by fire, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
immediately she guessed the nature of the device
that had been employed. She knew that
Masters in his work had had much experience
with explosives, and, in consequence, with
fuses of various sorts. She understood on
reflection that he had used in this instance a
fuse of such length as to permit his lighting
it a long time before the moment of firing.
Afterward, he had been able to leave the rifle
unattended, confident that at the instant designed
by him it would be fired automatically
by the burning of the fuse. But, a minute later,
it occurred to her that the trigger required to
be pulled backward in order to discharge the
weapon. The parting of the string she had
discovered could by no means effect this. She
had let the obscuring branch swing back into
place the while she meditated. Now, she again
thrust it out of the way, so that the light shone
in brightly, as she bent to another scrutiny
of the rifle. Her investigation was instantly
rewarded, for she perceived a coil of spring,
which ran from the trigger to one of the
branches. Its blackness had hidden it from her
eyes hitherto. The discovery made all clear.
The cord had held the trigger forward in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
usual place, acting against the power of the
spring. Then, the burning of the string by the
fuse had left the trigger unprotected against
the pull of the spring, which, suddenly effective,
had fired the rifle. The ingenuity of the
scheme confounded the girl, as she sat staring
at the evidences of treachery. Yet, in that
moment of anguish, she was moved to murmur
a prayer of thankfulness that the knowledge of
her lover&#8217;s character had come to her in time
to save her life from misery and degradation
as his wife.</p>

<p>After a long time crouched there in the tree,
May bestirred herself slowly and clambered
down, leaving the rifle as she had found it, with
the bit of charred string hanging, and the
spring holding the trigger pulled, as it had been
at the moment of the shot. It did not occur to
her that it might be wiser to carry away these
proofs of attempted murder. Indeed, in that
first understanding of the guilt of Masters,
she was too distraught to think clearly. She
could only feel the vicarious shame that was
hers by reason of him to whom she had
accorded her love. Nor did she just then speculate
much as to the exact motive that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
actuated the engineer. She took it for granted
that he had been influenced to his course by
motives of greed, as was the fact in the main.
She supposed that he had thought the murder
of Saxe Temple would cause a delay in the
search, by which he might profit to the extent
of finding the treasure himself. It did not
occur to her that an older and more primitive
passion than greed, even, one more savage,
too, might have driven him on to the crime.
In her horrified amazement over the deed
itself, she quite forgot the jealousy that had
sprung in her heart by reason of her lover&#8217;s
devotion to Margaret West. Yet, at that very
moment, the man who had just striven in vain
to redden his hands with the blood of a fellow
creature, was with Margaret West in a bowered
nook of the shore, pouring forth the story
of his love in passionate phrases.</p>

<small>THE SECRET VAULT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MAY passed a sleepless night, wearying
her brain in a futile endeavor to see her
path clearly. She felt that, for the sake of
what had been, she could not bring herself to
accuse Masters before the others, or even privately
to his face. Yet, her manifest duty lay
in some step that should prevent another effort
by him. She was convinced that he would dare
no more, when aware of the fact that there
was a witness to bear testimony as to his guilt,
and in this she probably reasoned justly. In
the end, she decided to write him a note,
informing him as to her knowledge, and warning
him against further pursuit of his evil
plans, or of herself. She would have the missive
in readiness to hand to him on the occasion
of his first appearance at the cottage.</p>

<p>When she had thus determined, it was time
to dress, for the day was two hours old. As
soon as she was clad with her accustomed
nicety, she wrote the letter to the engineer, and
then descended to breakfast, pale and wan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
with heavy shadows under her eyes, but vastly
relieved that, at last, she had reached a decision
as to her conduct of the affair.</p>

<p>The letter thus prepared was not destined
for delivery that day. Masters did not appear
at the cottage. As a matter of fact, even his
egotism was convinced of the sincerity and
unchangeableness of Margaret West&#8217;s rejection
of his suit. He found to his despair and
wrath that the girl was totally irresponsive
to his most ardent pleadings. The disappointment
to him was the keener because it was so
wholly unexpected. The girl had shown pleasure
in his society from the first, and he had
anticipated an easy victory, despite his jealousy
of Saxe. Nevertheless, she repulsed him
with a finality not to be denied. His failure
was the more exasperating to him by reason
of the fact that the cause baffled his every
effort of understanding.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter lay in a paradox
concerning magnetism. Masters possessed in
an unusual degree the magnetism of sex. At
the outset, Margaret had felt this, without in
the least apprehending the nature of the attraction
exerted on her. She attributed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
rather to his handsome face and buoyant manner,
allied with his undoubted cleverness.
Later on, as the man&#8217;s passion for her developed,
this same force in him, which had
charmed in its subtler manifestations, became
offensive to her sensitiveness. Still without
any suspicion of the cause, she felt herself
repelled, where before she had been attracted.
By so much the more as his desire waxed and
was revealed, by so much the more he grew
repulsive. In the end, he became altogether
detestable to her, and in dismissing him she
made her feeling plain.</p>

<p>So, Masters did not come that day to the
cottage, and the note that lay warm on
May&#8217;s bosom was undelivered. Yet his dual
lack of success in love and in murder did not
suffice to quench the spirit of the man. Greed
and passion inflamed his hatred of the rival
who threatened to destroy his hopes. As he
went from Margaret at her bidding, his brain
was already busy with new schemes by which
to possess himself of the miser&#8217;s gold and of
the woman he loved. The first step toward
such consummation must be the death of Saxe
Temple. He was furious against the fate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
had saved his enemy at the first trial; he was
determined that at the second there should be
no escape.</p>

<p>The night following that on which the shooting
had occurred, Roy Morton passed through
an experience that afforded him grounds for
apprehension, although he kept the affair
secret for a time, in the confident expectation
of making further discoveries without assistance
from his friends.</p>

<p>It was about two o&#8217;clock in the morning
when he suddenly awakened out of a sound
sleep. He attributed this awakening to a subtle
warning from his never-sleeping sixth sense.
Nevertheless, it is a fact that, in the course of
an adventurous career, he had acquired the
habit of sleeping very lightly, so that he might
be aroused instantly by the slightest sound of
an unwonted sort, and it is probable that, on
this occasion, some noise disturbed him. Be
that as it may, he abruptly found himself broad
awake and listening intently.</p>

<p>There was no sound anywhere within the
cottage. Through the open window came the
rhythmic chant of myriad insects, the rustling
of leaves caressed by the night wind&mdash;nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
more. Roy was inclined to believe that he had
been aroused for no adequate cause. Yet, he
was disinclined to dismiss the warning of his
precious sixth sense without further investigation.
He got out of bed, threw a bath-robe
over his pajamas, and set forth on a tour of
investigation. There was still some moonlight
shining through the windows of the hall, by
which he was able to assure himself that
nothing extraordinary was visible, nor did he
hear any unusual sound. He descended into
the lower hall, and there, too, his examination
failed to show aught amiss. He moved with
great caution, in order to avoid giving warning
of his presence to a possible intruder, and
peered into the office and the dining-room.
Everywhere, he found all in order. He betook
himself finally to the door of the music-room,
which he found almost closed, but not quite.
He pushed it open with much care, and bending
forward, looked into the room. On the
instant, his eyes were attracted by a light that
shone clearly against the east wall of the room.
By this illumination, he perceived a man, who
knelt, holding a pocket-torch in his left hand,
while his right was thrust into an opening in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the wall.</p>

<p>Roy Morton stared in unqualified amazement.
For the moment, his interest was centered
on the aperture in the wall of the room,
rather than on the man who knelt on the floor
before it, with his arm thrust into the recess
up to the shoulder. In that instant, Roy was
seized with the conviction that he had stumbled
upon the treasure of Abernethey by means of
a monition from his sixth sense, and his heart
was filled with gladness, both for the sake of
his friend&#8217;s fortune thus at last secured, and
for the sake of his own pride in being the active
agent in that consummation. He had no doubt
whatever that the man crouched on the floor
was Masters, though the face was unrecognizable
in the shadow. He even suffered a little
pang of jealousy that the fellow should have
succeeded in discovering the golden treasury,
while he and his friends had so signally failed.
He comforted wounded vanity, however, with
the trite reflection that all is well that ends
well. It seemed, indeed, that the affair had
now become simplicity itself, since there remained
only to watch the operations of the
thief, and ultimately to possess himself of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
gold in his friend&#8217;s behalf.</p>

<p>It appeared to the observer that the position
of the man on the floor left him subject to
great disadvantage under attack, and that,
therefore, it were wise not to delay action.
Roy desired to capture the marauder single-handed
for the sake of his own greater glory.
He had no question as to his ability to overcome
the engineer in a hand-to-hand contest,
despite the fellow&#8217;s excellent physique. With
the idea of taking his enemy by surprise, he
pushed the door farther ajar, to make space
for a leap forward. Notwithstanding his caution,
the hinges creaked with a sudden, harsh
noise, which crashed through the silence of the
night. In the same second, Roy sprang.</p>

<p>At the sound of the opening door, the torch
had clicked into darkness&mdash;there was the slithering
of rubber-shod feet across the floor. As
Roy came upon emptiness where had been the
man, he heard the rustling of the drawn shade
of a window. He saw dimly against the outer
light the silhouette of the thief in the opening.
Before he could move, it had vanished. He
was after it with all speed, but, by the time he
stood on the ground outside, he could neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
see nor hear aught to give an idea as to the
direction of the flight. He went forward
blindly, moving here and there haphazard,
pausing often to listen. There was no reward
to his efforts, and, after a few minutes, realizing
the uselessness of longer search, he
returned to the cottage, where he entered the
open window.</p>

<p>It was just as he dropped to the floor that
a cheering thought came to Roy. The man
had carried away nothing in his flight. At
the moment of the door&#8217;s creaking, the hand
had been withdrawn from the cavity within
the wall, and it had been empty. Evidently,
the depredator had been interrupted just when
he had succeeded in coming on the secret place
of the gold. As he realized this, Roy went
forward quickly in the direction of the piano-lamp,
found matches, made a light, and turned
eagerly toward the recess in the wall. As he
knelt in the place so recently occupied by that
other visitor, there was light enough to see
clearly, and he beheld the safe set behind the
wainscoting. The steel doors stood ajar; the
first glance showed that the receptacle was
empty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>Amazement was Roy&#8217;s dominant emotion
for the first few moments. It gave place to
chagrin. He strove to disbelieve the evidence
of his eyes, but disbelief was impossible. The
safe was empty. He thrust his hand within,
and felt about carefully, even as the man had
done&mdash;only to find nowhere so much as a scrap
of paper that might have held a clue. The
shock of the disappointment stunned him. For
a long time, he sat before the opening in the
wall, squatting motionless on his haunches,
nursing a swiftly rising rage.</p>

<p>Roy stood up at last, with an ejaculation of
disgust. Then, curiosity laid hold on him, and
he began a careful examination of the vault&#8217;s
mechanism. He pushed the inner doors of
steel shut, but without turning the handle to
shoot the bolt. Afterward, he scrutinized the
portion of the wainscoting that was swung outward
to reveal the safe. He moved it to and
fro, a little way slowly, finding that it was very
delicately balanced, so that it responded to the
lightest touch. He inspected the bolts with
which it was fitted, and sought to understand
exactly the method of their operation, but this
persistently escaped him, nothwithstanding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
knowledge of mechanical appliances. It was
while he was pulling at one of the bolts that
the impetus of his effort sent the section of
wainscoting into its usual place as a part of
the wall. Roy tried to catch it in order to
prevent its closing, but he was just too late.
He tugged at a projection of the carving, only
to find that the masked door resisted his
strength. He realized that the bolts had been
thrust into their sockets by some device automatic
in the act of closing. Greatly annoyed,
he began a hunt for the secret spring by which
the operation of the bolts must be controlled.
In this he failed. Try as he would, the wainscoting
rested there before him in an immobility
beyond measure exasperating. He went
over the entire surface with painstaking care,
pressing or pulling at each hollow or projection,
and always there was the same irritating
lack of response. Roy, with his chin thrust
forward belligerently, toiled on in countless
futile experiments, only to confess defeat. He
was worn with fatigue from the monotonous
labor when at last a distant sound startled him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
and he looked around, to discover that day had
come. Fearful lest he be discovered there, he
fled to his room, disgusted by the fiasco. For
the first time in his life, he sneered at that
delusive faculty, the sixth sense.</p>

<small>THE CLUE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">TO THE astonishment of Roy Morton
and May Thurston, this day also passed
without the appearance of the engineer at
the cottage. The girl, at first experiencing
some alarm over this protracted absence,
was afterward filled with relief, when it
occurred to her that Masters was keeping
away because he had finally abandoned his
evil intentions. She felt convinced that the
failure of his attempt to murder Temple had
brought him to realization of the heinousness
of his conduct. The thought afforded
her great satisfaction, since it relieved her
of any necessity for action against him. The
change in the situation so cheered her that
she accepted with animation Roy&#8217;s invitation
to walk, and the two passed a particularly
agreeable hour in strolling through the
woods, finding each topic of conversation
charming, and almost forgetting that such
an one as the engineer encumbered the earth.</p>

<p>There came another development in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
evening, when the four friends were smoking
and chatting, as was their custom after the
ladies had retired for the night. They were
in the music-room with Saxe at the piano,
where he had been playing from time to
time. Now, however, he had ceased, and
rested motionless, with his eyes fixed on the
sheet of manuscript left by Abernethey, in
a wearisome wondering as to the message
that might lie concealed within that bare presentment
of the song of gold&mdash;as he had
come to call the composition. Billy Walker
had steadfastly maintained his belief that the
clue to the treasure was hidden there, and
Saxe was impressed by the idea, although
his reason declared it folly.</p>

<p>Presently, Billy aroused himself from the
luxury of the morris chair, where he had
been communing with an especially black
cigar, heaved himself erect with a groan, and
crossed the room to the piano. He stood for
a little while in silence, staring down at the
written page on the rack.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; he demanded. He pointed
to the three measures that stood alone at the
head of the sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="center">[<a href="music/lake_mystery_music.midi">Listen</a>]</p>

<p>The phrase to which Billy Walker pointed
was scrawled in a fashion that was rather
slovenly as compared with the remainder of
the manuscript. Hitherto, in spite of the
many times he had studied the manuscript,
Saxe had given small heed to this fragment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of writing, which preceded the song of gold.
Now, however, at his friend&#8217;s instigation, he
examined it with scrupulous care before he
spoke. Then, he shook his head in discouragement,
as he struck the notes on the
keyboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t mean anything, Billy,&#8221; he
declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s it there for, if it doesn&#8217;t mean
anything?&#8221; the other persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; Saxe answered, &#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s
simply that the old man had some sort of
an idea, and jotted down a note concerning
it. You see, it&#8217;s at the top of the page. He
did nothing more with it. Afterward, he
used the same sheet to write the gold song
on. He was a miser, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; Billy conceded. &#8220;All the
same, I think, in this instance, he would have
been comparatively extravagant. I still
believe that the bit there has some significance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t mean anything,&#8221; he repeated,
drearily. He was fast yielding to discouragement.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>For a long minute the two were silent,
regarding the manuscript intently, with knit
brows. Then, of a sudden, Billy&#8217;s rough
voice boomed forth a question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there letters on a staff of music?
What are the letters there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe smiled, in some disdain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good may they do you!&#8221; he said;
and his tone was sarcastic. &#8220;The letters
are, B, E, D, A, C. Might be a word in
Magyar, for all I know. It isn&#8217;t from any
language more common, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy snorted indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not altogether impossible that it
should be a word from some language or
other,&#8221; he answered, stoutly. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
investigate it more closely on an English
basis first. Now, what&mdash;exactly&mdash;does that
Italian word mean, there over the music.
And what&#8217;s it doing there, anyhow?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe laughed outright at the utter simplicity
of the question from the musician&#8217;s
standpoint.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a word to guide the player in his
interpretation,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;It means that
this particular phrase should be played with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
great slowness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy pondered this statement for a time,
then vented a lusty sigh of disappointment.
Presently, however, his expression took on
animation again, for curiosity had hit on a
new point of interest.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are those two vertical lines doing
there in the middle?&#8221; he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>Saxe shrugged his shoulders resignedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They, too, mean nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;They&#8217;re in the
same class as &#8216;Bedac&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;According to my theory concerning this
affair,&#8221; Billy asserted with an air of dogmatism,
&#8220;you are wrong in thus dismissing, one
after another, the possibilities of the situation.
Now, we have before us a manuscript, which is
undoubtedly the work of the man who left
this gold to you, if you could find it. He
explicitly stated in his communication to
you that the clue to the hiding-place was
clear enough. You might infer, since the
money was left you in this fashion, that the
clue would be of a musical sort. He was a
musician. Music was his one specialty. It
is also your own specialty. It is, then, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
most natural thing in the world to suppose
that, in one way or another, music would
play a chief part in this matter. Following
the sequence of facts, we come next to one
that follows logically in the line of argument.
For we come upon a piece of music, which
is in manuscript. It is actually, we are convinced,
a piece composed by the late Mr.
Abernethey. We have ascertained from his
secretary that it is written in his own handwriting.
Finally, we are sure that it is the
only thing coming directly from him that
there is in the house, which offers by its
individuality a possibility of having a cryptic
meaning of the sort required by us in the
prosecution of the search.</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat my firm belief that in this page of
music lies the clue to the late Mr. Abernethey&#8217;s
secret. If I am right, then any
single character on this sheet may be of vital
importance. You sneer at &#8216;Bedac,&#8217; which at
first glance seems gibberish, and nothing
more. There remains the possibility, nevertheless,
that it may have a meaning of prime
importance to you. A fortune may depend
on your learning the meaning of that word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Don&#8217;t dismiss it after just one glance. Don&#8217;t
sneer at it&mdash;and those two vertical lines!
You say, they are void of purport. The
fact is that they don&#8217;t belong there&mdash;from
your musical standpoint. Well, they&#8217;re
there, notwithstanding. The late Mr. Abernethey
put them there. Perhaps they stood
for something to him, in spite of the fact
that they don&#8217;t to you. Anyhow, don&#8217;t sneer
at them&mdash;yet. Wait, at least, until you&#8217;ve
really studied them. As far as our present
knowledge goes, this paper must hold the
clue. I tell you, it&#8217;s worth working on&mdash;hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>The harsh, sonorous voice in this long
harangue had soon cut short the desultory
chat between Roy and David, who had
listened almost from the beginning with
attention, while smiling a little at the earnestness
of the speaker in pursuing his argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Billy,&#8221; David remarked, &#8220;you&#8217;re
the one to work out the problem on logical
lines. You&#8217;ve told the rest of us often
enough that we can&#8217;t reason.&#8221; The other
two nodded assent, smiling cheerfully on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
nonplussed oracle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m horribly handicapped by my ignorance
of music,&#8221; he confessed, wryly. Then,
his rough features settled into lines of
resolve, and his voice fairly roared in the
echoing room: &#8220;But, by the Lord! I&#8217;ll do
it&mdash;I&#8217;ll work that thing out, if I have to learn
music first!&#8221;</p>

<p>There came a shout of laughter from the
three; the vision of Billy Walker thus
engaged was too ludicrous! Notwithstanding
their merriment, there came no relaxation
of the set purpose in the speaker&#8217;s face.
It was evident that he was wholly sincere
in his announcement. Indeed, no sooner had
the mirth exhausted itself than he craved a
first lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me about the letters that are on the
staff,&#8221; he besought Saxe, who good-naturedly
complied, with a smile still on his
lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, that&#8217;s all the letters there are in
musical notation,&#8221; Billy exclaimed, when the
instructor paused. There was distinct disappointment
in his voice. &#8220;Only, A, B, C,
D, E, F, G. That&#8217;s bad. Yet there are two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
vowels, A and E, and E is the most important
vowel.&#8221; He fell silent, standing moveless
before the piano, with his gaze fixed on
the manuscript in a brown study. &#8220;Bedac!&#8221;
he muttered, after a little; and Saxe, hearing,
smiled again. &#8220;And those vertical lines!&#8221;
he mused aloud. Saxe kindly volunteered
some information as to the purpose served
by bars to separate the measures. When he
ceased, Billy propounded a question, which
was an affirmation: &#8220;Then, there is a measure
with nothing in it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, in a way!&#8221; Saxe replied. &#8220;Only, this
isn&#8217;t really a measure. It&#8217;s merely a mistake
the old man happened to make&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why isn&#8217;t it a measure?&#8221; came the crisp
demand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, if it were really meant for a
measure, it would contain something, either
notes or rests, or both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may thank your lucky stars I&#8217;m not
a musician,&#8221; Billy declared, and he snorted
loudly in contempt. &#8220;You&#8217;re hide-bound, so
to speak, by the technique of your art.
Thank heaven, I have an open mind.
Because the thing is different, you assert that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
it can&#8217;t possibly have any meaning. For my
part, on the contrary, the fact that it&#8217;s different
is just why I suspect it to be of importance.
I give the late Mr. Abernethey credit
for some cleverness. Also, I deem him to
have been capable of a bit of originality. The
manner of his will suggests that possibility,
at least. If he amused himself by evolving
a musical cipher, I&#8217;ll warrant he didn&#8217;t construct
a mere tonic sol-fa&mdash;whatever that
may be&mdash;which any piano-banger could sing
at sight to this tune here. I&#8217;ve always
thought that much knowledge of technique
was deadening. Now, I know it. The critic
knows technique perfectly; the genius never
does. Here, I&#8217;ll take it. You&#8217;ll do no good,
muddling over it!&#8221; With this pronouncement,
Billy Walker rudely leaned forward,
and snatched the sheet of music from the
rack, and stalked away with it to the morris
chair, leaving Saxe well content with such
ending of the inquisition.</p>

<p>It was a half-hour later. Saxe had joined
Roy and David, and the three were talking
pleasantly of many things as they smoked.
Throughout the whole time, Billy had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
remained huddled in the easy chair, his cigar,
unlighted, clenched firmly between his teeth,
his fierce, shaggy brows drawn down, his
little, dull eyes set steadfastly on the sheet
of music, which lay on his knees. Occasionally,
there sounded an unintelligible mumbling
from his lips, or a raucous grunt of
dissatisfaction. Then, with disconcerting
abruptness, the scholar lifted his head, ran
his hands roughly through the bristling,
unkempt thatch of hair, and exploded into
Gargantuan laughter.</p>

<p>The three regarded him in perplexity,
smiling a little under the contagion of his
merriment. He gave no heed to their questions
for a full minute, but continued his
rollicking mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve made the first step toward the
treasure,&#8221; he announced, at last. The rolling
volume of his voice was more thunderous
even than its wont.</p>

<p>Came a chorus of ejaculations and questions
from the others, as they sprang to their
feet, and crowded about him.</p>

<p>Billy waved his hand imperiously for
silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>&#8220;But it&#8217;s only the first step, remember!&#8221;
he warned. &#8220;The first step! And, incidentally,
it proves that I was right about the
value of this document.&#8221; He flourished the
music aloft, in a gesture of triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us! Tell us!&#8221; was the cry.</p>

<p>Billy regarded his friends quizzically.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the first step that I have taken,
remember,&#8221; he admonished. &#8220;But, as Saint
Augustine said, it&#8217;s the first step that counts.
The miser&#8217;s gold is somewhere at the bottom
of the lake.&#8221;</p>

<p>There followed an interval of astounded
silence. It was broken by Roy with an
exclamation of bewilderment:</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221; he began. Then, he halted in
confusion. He had been on the point of
saying something concerning the secret
vault in the music-room, and had checked
himself only just in time. The others, however,
had given no attention to his utterance,
and he sighed with relief. It had flashed on
him that his own knowledge in a way corroborated
the statement by Billy, inasmuch
as he found the vault empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;How? How?&#8221; Saxe was clamoring;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
David added his insistence.</p>

<p>Billy Walker preened himself with all the
pride of a great discoverer, as well he might.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was simplicity itself,&#8221; he assured them.
&#8220;It was only necessary for me to learn music,
and the matter soon became clear.&#8221; Saxe
and the others fairly gaped at the nave
assumption on the part of their friend that,
in five minutes, he had mastered the art, but
they did not care to question his complacency
just then. &#8220;Being unhampered by over-much
technique,&#8221; the oracle continued, with
buoyant self-satisfaction, &#8220;I was able to
investigate with an open mind, examining
all the facts.&#8221; He paused to grin exultantly
on the expectant trio, and then resumed his
explanation:</p>

<p>&#8220;I had before me two determined facts,
which gave no information in themselves,
but required perhaps only the addition of
other facts to become significant. Now,
observe this lone bit of music at the head of
the page.&#8221; He held up the sheet, so that
the others could note the phrase at the top.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_190.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>&#8220;The first fact of which I was possessed,&#8221;
Billy went on, &#8220;thanks to the tuition in music
afforded me by Saxe, was this: that the letters
of the fragment are, B, E, D, A, C, in
such order. At the outset of my logical
examination, I attempted variations in this
order, as offering the simplest solution of the
puzzle. After some experimenting, I became
convinced that the secret was not concealed
in a changed sequence of the letters. Next,
then, I set myself to a consideration of the
second fact. This consisted in the knowledge
that the bit of music contained a
measure that was not a measure. That is
to say, there was the marking of a measure
by two vertical lines, but nothing in that
measure, neither notes nor rests. This
impressed me as of importance in all probability.
The same fact that led Saxe to disregard
it, led me to scrutinize it with
particularity.&#8221; Again, Billy paused, to allow
his hearers a moment in which to meditate
on the shrewdness of his reasoning. When
he went on speaking, his voice carried a note
of increased contentment:</p>

<p>&#8220;Above this measure that is no measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
this measure that is empty, I perceived a
pointer, of a size sufficient even to have attracted
the notice of my friend here, hide-bound in
technique as he is&mdash;but it did not. The
pointer directed attention straight to a letter&mdash;a
letter placed exactly over the measure
that isn&#8217;t a measure because it&#8217;s empty.
That letter thus pointed out is L. It fitted
very well into the blank place with the other
letters. So, where before we had only, B, E,
D, A, C, we now have, B, E, D, L, A, C.&#8221;
Billy ceased speaking, and surveyed the
others happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you go on?&#8221; David
demanded, impatiently.</p>

<p>Billy regarded the questioner in genuine
astonishment, tinged with contempt. His
gaze darted to the other two, and, on realizing
that they, as well, were still uncomprehending,
he groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Non-rationalizing nincompoops!&#8221; was
his candid murmur of reprobation. &#8220;Oh, well,
I shall explain, if it be possible to your understanding,&#8221;
he said gently, with an assumption
of infinite patience. &#8220;As you musical sharps
are aware, the musical notation comprises only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
seven letters, namely&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, never mind that!&#8221; Saxe cried. &#8220;We
know!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; was the retort. &#8220;You only
know it as a matter of technical knowledge,
not as a fact from which to reason. The
point is that there&#8217;s no K in the musical
scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; The monosyllable snapped from
Roy. His face was set intently, the chin a
little forward, the eyes hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;The thing is simply this,&#8221; Billy answered,
beaming. &#8220;The late Mr. Abernethey, on
account of the lack of the letter K in the
musical notation, was compelled to resort
to an expedient. He could not indicate the
word &#8216;Lake&#8217; on his cipher, since he was without
either L or K. He evaded the difficulty
by employing the initial letter from a word
of direction, Largo, which provided the necessary
L, and he got around the lack of the
letter K by using the French word for Lake&mdash;<i>lac</i>.
This fragment at the head of the
sheet spells for us, &#8216;Bedlac&#8217;.&#8221; He pointed to
the phrase again, as he concluded.</p>

<p>&#8220;So, we have only to do a bit of translating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
from the French <i>lac</i> into the English lake,
and then to amplify by supplying the obvious
preposition and article, and the writing
declares clearly: &#8216;The Bed of the Lake.&#8217; It
now remains for us to study this page until
we learn just where under the water of the
lake out there the gold is lying. Somewhere,
somehow, this music tells!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE EPISODE OF THE LAUNCH</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE clue discovered by Billy Walker was
accepted without hesitation. No secret
was made of the information thus obtained
as the first progress in the search for the
gold, and an air of excitement prevailed in
and about the cottage. Jake, especially, was
all agog with interest in the new development,
and took an active part in the subsequent
operations, since the four friends now
spent much of their time on the water, hoping
by some fortunate chance to come on a
suggestion for further guidance. They went
cruising out of sheer desperation, having no
precise idea to follow until more should be
learned from the manuscript. All pinned
their faith to the music left by the miser.
Each spent hours in study of the scrawled
notes in the quest of added discovery, but
all efforts were futile. Even the redoubtable
Billy himself admitted humiliating defeat.
Yet, he was in no wise cast down by the
failure of the moment. He was sure of ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
victory for the orderly processes of
reason. Roy, on the other hand, retained his
confidence in the final revelation that had
been foretold by his industrious sixth sense,
and David shared this optimistic trust in the
occult. As for Saxe, when day after day
passed without a hint of new knowledge concerning
the gold, he might easily have
become hopeless, had it not been for the
diversion of interest offered by his love-affair.
For now the manner of Margaret
West toward him was such that sometimes
he dared believe it possible to win her.</p>

<p>May Thurston was assured by the continued
absence of Masters that he had abandoned
further vicious effort. In this view,
the girl did the indefatigable scoundrel less
than justice. As a matter of fact, the engineer
was very busy indeed. He had kept
away from the cottage because he feared that
May might have guessed his agency in the
attack directed against Saxe, although he
had taken the precaution to remove the rifle
and its accessories from the sapling on the
day after the shooting. He suspected, too,
that May would learn from Margaret the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
truth concerning his treachery in love&mdash;in
which suspicion he was quite wrong&mdash;and
he deemed himself safer out of the injured
girl&#8217;s sight. So, he kept himself hidden
from the household of the cottage, while still
devoting himself to malevolent schemes.
Hope developed in him that he might yet
win Margaret West&mdash;if only Saxe were out
of the path. In addition, the removal of this
rival would allow him another chance, even
if brief, to search for the treasure. He was
determined that Saxe should die, straightway.
To that consummation, he set himself
with cold-blooded ingenuity.</p>

<p>It was on a splendid morning a week later
that the four friends were taking another
trip in the motor-boat, to examine the
extreme northern end of the lake. Jake was
at the steering-wheel, as always, for the
abundant sunken rocks and shoals forbade
a stranger as pilot in these waters. Roy sat
beside the boatman, as his custom was, while
Saxe and David were in chairs behind, and
Billy, puffing his black cigar, lounged contentedly
in the stern.</p>

<p>Saxe shook his head impatiently, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
smell of gasoline, instead of the balsamic
fragrance of the shore, afflicted his nostrils.
He spoke of the annoyance to David, who
agreed that the scent was unusually strong
in the boat that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be a bit of a leak somewhere,&#8221;
David vouchsafed. He called a question to
Roy, who merely shook his head by way of
answer. &#8220;They wouldn&#8217;t get the smell up
there, anyhow,&#8221; David continued, to Saxe.
&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s floating round in the bilge
right under us, so that we get the worst of
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe had just time to wonder, without
much real concern, whether or not it were
quite prudent of Billy to be smoking where
so large a quantity of gasoline was loose&mdash;then,
the catastrophe came&mdash;came with
lightning swiftness&mdash;a huge burst of flame
enveloped them.</p>

<p>In that first second of horror, common
instinct driving, the five men plunged into
the lake. The motor-boat sped on, the
engines still throbbing. Saxe, as he rose
from the leap, and tossed his head to clear
the water from his eyes, chanced to be facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in its direction, and could see only a swirling
mass of flames, darting onward toward the
shore. Then, a cry startled him to concern
over his companions. He turned quickly,
and, to his relief, saw four heads appearing
above the water. In the same instant, relief
yielded to fear, for one of them vanished
below the surface. It was David.</p>

<p>Saxe, who was a practised swimmer, shot
forward to the rescue in a powerful racing
stroke. As he raised his head from the water
a moment later, horror gripped him anew&mdash;now,
only two heads were showing. Billy
had disappeared. But his emotion changed
to delight as he covered the short distance
between him and the place where David had
sunk, for suddenly two heads rose above the
water. He saw David supported in the arms
of Billy, who was treading water in a lazy
fashion all his own.</p>

<p>That was the end of the actual peril. Saxe
aided David on the side opposite Billy, and
the two had no difficulty, since David,
though unable to swim, retained his coolness,
leaving himself limp to the control of
his rescuers. The land was less than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
hundred yards away, and thither the five
wrecked men went, and clambered out upon
the shore, bedraggled, dripping, scorched,
half-angry, half-dazed by the suddenness of
it all, but wholly thankful for their escape
from the dual dangers of fire and flood. The
chief mourner was Jake, who lamented with
tears over the loss of the boat he had learned
to love.</p>

<p>Presently, the others began to rally Billy
Walker on his unsuspected skill in the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;When in the world did you ever learn to
swim?&#8221; Roy demanded. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t know
how when you were in the university.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No such thing!&#8221; Billy retorted, huffily.
&#8220;I could swim before I was seven years old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you never did swim during all the
time I&#8217;ve known you,&#8221; Saxe exclaimed,
astounded by the revelation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not!&#8221; was the crisp reply.
&#8220;Why should I? Each person has just so
much energy to draw on for his use, for all
purposes whatever. I don&#8217;t fritter my
energy away on trifles, like swimming for
mere amusement. I prefer to employ my
vital forces in intellectual pursuits.&#8221; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
paused to grin maliciously at the others.
&#8220;That&#8217;s where I differ from you chaps&mdash;yes!
But, when the occasion arises, why, then I
swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy and Jake made a trip to the ruins of
the motor-boat, which had beached itself
on the north shore, a quarter of a mile to the
east of the point reached by the men. Meantime,
the three others started at a leisurely
pace to the west, skirting the shore until
they rounded the lake, and turned to the
south on their way to the cottage. Their
rate of progress was so slow that within a
half-hour Roy and Jake rejoined them, and
with this completion of their number the
speed was quickened. It was a full five miles
to the cottage, but the sun and the breeze
soon dried their clothing; the paths by which
Jake led them wound through charming
forest stretches; they were happy anew over
the gracious gift of life. So, they swung
forward with free footsteps through the
miles. Even Billy Walker, who ordinarily
would groan if required to stroll the distance
from the cottage to the boat-house, seemed
for once to have put off lethargy, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
marched at the head of the procession with
Jake, and set the pace smartly.</p>

<p>The full significance of the disaster was
not revealed until the afternoon of the next
day, when Jake returned from a second
inspection of the wreck. His round, wizened
face displayed evidences of excitement, and
his tiny eyes were snapping, as he rushed
into the presence of the four friends, who
were taking their ease on the landing-stage
of the boat-house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I found out somethin&#8217;!&#8221; he announced.
There was a note of savageness in his voice
that puzzled the hearers. &#8220;I been up to see
the <i>Shirtso</i>, and I found out somethin&#8217;!&#8221; He
stared with gloomy eyes at Roy. &#8220;I found
out what caused that-thar leak o&#8217; gas. The
feed pipe was cut!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;&#8221; Roy questioned, tensely.</p>

<p>&#8220;The feed pipe was cut,&#8221; Jake repeated,
There was rage in his voice now. &#8220;And
somebody done it a-purpose&mdash;cuss &#8217;m!&#8221;</p>

<small>THE CHART</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IT WAS the belief of Saxe and his friends
that the person guilty of the outrage
against them was none other than Hartley
Masters. Now, at last, Roy confided to his
associates the adventure in the night, when
he had discovered the presence of the safe
hidden within the wall. The others flouted
him as he had anticipated over his failure to
capture the intruder and his subsequent
inability to learn the secret of the spring in
the wainscoting. They accepted without
hesitation his assurance that the night
prowler had been Masters, and their wrath
flamed hot against the engineer, who in his
later effort had not scrupled to attempt the
murder of five men. They determined to
take active measures against the fellow for the
sake of their own safety. Roy volunteered to
wage a campaign against the enemy, to seek
out his whereabouts, to trail him, to get evidence
against him, and finally to make him
prisoner. The others, meantime, would continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
their quest for further clues to the
treasure. First of all, they busied themselves
with hunting for the concealed safe, after its
exact situation had been indicated by Roy,
and three days passed in fruitless experimenting
on the intricacies of the carved
wainscoting.</p>

<p>Roy visited the hamlet at the foot of the
lake, where was situated the hotel in which
the engineer had been a guest. He learned,
to his disappointment, that Masters had
taken his departure a week before. He
assured himself that this departure had been
a real one by inquiries at the station. Further
questioning of residents elicited the
information that the engineer had thereafter
been seen by none. Nevertheless, Roy was
far from being convinced by this information
that the engineer had actually taken himself
off. He was, on the contrary, almost, if not
quite, certain that Masters had merely made
use of the train for an ostensible departure, in
order to avoid the possibility of his presence
in the neighborhood appearing as evidence
against him in the event of any suspicion
that might arise. Afterward, as Roy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
imagined, he had returned to some out-of-the-way
place in the forest, where he could
eat and sleep unmolested, and thence spy
out the land for the execution of his villainous
projects. Doubtless in his employment
as an engineer, he had often lived roughly,
and the season of the year would make life
in the open no hardship. Roy, therefore, set
himself to a search of the countryside, hoping
somewhere to chance on a trace of the
enemy&#8217;s camp. In this, he was unsuccessful.
After two days of weary tramping, it occurred
to him that he could serve his purpose
equally well by strolling in pleasant paths
with May Thurston at his side.</p>

<p>This improved method was adopted. Roy
told the girl nothing as to his desire of finding
Masters, but he told her other things
a-plenty; and the two of them grew daily
more content.</p>

<p>It was Margaret West who finally hit on
the spring that moved the wainscoting, for
Saxe had let her know the story told by Roy,
and she had amused herself by seeking to master
the mystery. Actually, beyond her
satisfaction in having succeeded where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
others had failed, nothing was accomplished,
since the vault was empty, and no hint as to
the disposal of the gold could be gleaned
from its bareness. Yet, new knowledge of
the secret was soon to come.</p>

<p>Billy Walker&#8217;s pride of intellect had been
aroused to the utmost by the difficulty of
the task that confronted him. Hour after
hour, day after day, he pored over the manuscript,
of which the cryptic significance ever
escaped all efforts of his ingenuity. It
seemed to him that he had, in fact, scrutinized
every possible aspect in which the writing
might be viewed, and still the veil lay
impenetrable over the mystery. He would
have been in despair, had he been of a
humbler mind, but his intellectual egotism
would not suffer him to confess defeat, even
to himself. So, he persisted in the struggle
to solve this baffling problem&mdash;did indeed
but strive the harder as the days passed. The
others admitted that the difficulties were too
great for their overcoming. Billy replied to
their lamentations with braggart boasting
that he would yet conquer. Nevertheless, at
the last, he owed the hint he needed to Saxe.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>The four men were lounging on the porch
of a morning. The languor of summer had
grown within a few days, and the four were
taking their ease. Billy Walker was
crouched in the deeps of a huge chair; David
sprawled on a heap of cushions; Roy
stretched lazily in a hammock, reminiscent
of long siestas in the southland. Saxe alone
showed any evidence of alertness. He sat
erect at the head of the steps, with the manuscript
of the gold song lying on his knees.
Ostensibly, his attention was fixed on the
music. From time to time, he jabbed the
score impatiently with a pencil point. But
often, he shot glances of longing toward the
stairway, by which, sooner or later, Margaret
West must descend. Silence had fallen on
the group. A sense of discouragement was
in the air. The only sounds were the gossiping
of the English sparrows about the eaves,
the faint rustling of leaves when the breeze
stirred them, the distressful grunt that
accompanied any change of position by
Billy Walker, the whish of a match as someone
lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>

<p>The real activity was on the part of Billy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
whose mind, while his body lolled, was
nimbly busy over the miser&#8217;s manuscript,
which his imagination held visible before
him. Then, presently, he craved the stimulus
of a sight of the actual. He hoisted his
cumbersome bulk out of the chair, and went
stiffly across the veranda to where Saxe sat
with the music. There, he stood for a minute
looking down at the notes. His beetling
brows were lowering, a low rumble of displeasure
came from his heavy lips, he thrust
a hand vehemently through the rough shock
of hair, his small eyes, with the whites
tainted by jaundice, fairly glared down at the
elusive script wherein lay knowledge of
Abernethey&#8217;s gold.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, wonder grew on his face.
Doubt, fear, hope, joy, followed. He bent
awkwardly, but swiftly, snatched the paper,
and immediately stalked off into the cottage
and up the stairs to his bedroom, without a
word of explanation or apology. Saxe
shrugged his shoulders, and smiled whimsically.
The others paid no attention whatsoever.</p>

<p>It was a half-hour later when Billy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
returned to the porch. His manner was
wholly changed. He was radiant with a
supreme triumph of pride. The others did
not look up, as he again seated himself in
the easy chair. But the man was so surcharged
with exultation that his mood sent
its challenges vibrant to their souls. Presently,
one turned to stare at him, and then
another, and then the third. He met their
gaze with eyes that were aglow, and a smile
of delight bent the coarse lips. He nodded
slowly, as in answer to their mute questioning,
and spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my dilatory friends,&#8221; he began
genially, &#8220;your confidence in me, which has
enabled you to retain your calm while yourselves
accomplishing nothing, was not misplaced.
After a considerable period of
unremitting toil over the manuscript left for
our guidance by the ingenious deceased&mdash;by
the way, Saxe, that song of gold, as you call
it, is perfectly good music, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The three were gazing on Billy Walker
with wide eyes. Their astonishment was so
great that, for the moment, they did not
question the leisurely manner of the sage&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
introduction. Instead, Saxe answered the
seemingly irrelevant interrogation obediently.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfectly good music&mdash;in the sense
you mean&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; Billy declared, &#8220;I take off my hat
to the late Mr. Abernethey. The reason for
this burst of enthusiasm on my part lies in
the fact that out of a perfectly good piece
of music, he has made, also, a perfectly good
chart&mdash;for our guidance to the treasure. As
to the chart, I myself speak as an authority,
since I have found it.&#8221; Billy regarded his
friends with an expression of intense self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>Roy was sitting up in the hammock now,
with his jaw thrust forward a little, and his
eyes hard in the excitement of the minute.
David was goggling, with his mouth
open in amazement over the unexpected
announcement. Saxe betrayed his emotion
by the tenseness of his features, the rigidity
of his pose, the sparkle in his keen, gray eyes.</p>

<p>It was evident that the successful investigator
was hugely enjoying the sensation he
had created. He delighted in the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of his accomplishment, gloried in the stunning
effect of it on his companions. He
smiled broadly, chuckled in a rumbling fashion
of his own, and finally lighted one of his
black cigars with irritating slowness. He
rather hoped that someone might exclaim
with impatience against this wanton delay,
but none did. They endured the suspense
in apparent calm, moveless, expectant. So
at last, Billy deigned to proceed with the
account of his achievement in solving the
mystery contrived by the miser.</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe the final suggestion by which I
won out to Saxe,&#8221; he declared frankly, with
an appreciative nod in his friend&#8217;s direction.
&#8220;He, however, really deserves no credit,
since what he did was merely by chance,
without any intention, and would never have
amounted to anything, if it hadn&#8217;t been for
the fact that I happened to see what he had
done, and to take advantage of it in an
orderly and logical way. Only, I wish it
understood that he served as the unconscious
instrument of destiny in the matter, and as
such unconscious instrument he should be
recognized. Probably, I should have arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
at the fact in time without his aid, but to it
I owe success on this present occasion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in the world did I do?&#8221; Saxe
demanded, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll explain in a minute,&#8221; Billy replied. &#8220;I
have in mind first to exhibit this to you.&#8221;
He held up a sheet of paper, which he had
drawn from his pocket. It was of about the
size of that on which Abernethey&#8217;s composition
had been written. It showed two irregular
lines running across it, drawn by pencil.
&#8220;Glance at this, if you please,&#8221; he directed.</p>

<p>The others did so; but their bewildered
expression showed that they were still unenlightened
as to the bearing of the scant
diagram on the revelation concerning the
hidden gold. Billy chuckled again in contemplation
of their failure to comprehend.
Then, he brought forth a second sheet, and
held it, also, for their inspection. In this
instance, the paper was turned with its
greater length horizontal, and the two lines
of the other sheet had been joined, so that
the one irregular tracing extended over the
full page.</p>

<p>David slapped his thigh with violence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>&#8220;By the Lord Harry, it&#8217;s a map!&#8221; he cried,
in glee. &#8220;A regular map, Billy, my boy!&#8221;
His eyes bulged forth until they threatened
to jump from their sockets.</p>

<p>Roy&#8217;s jaw shot out a bit farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a map,&#8221; he agreed; and his voice
was strangely gentle, as it usually was in his
moments of greatest excitement. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
map. Bully for Billy!&#8221; His face lighted
with a charming smile, and his eyes grew
soft as he turned them to the rough-hewn
face of the discoverer, who appeared highly
gratified.</p>

<p>Saxe took the sheet of paper out of his
friend&#8217;s hand, and studied it with eager eyes.
For the first time in days, hope leaped in
his breast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a map,&#8221; he declared, echoing the
others. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand. Tell us,
Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy actually preened himself, in an
ungainly manner peculiarly his own, and
assumed a most pedantic air, as he went
forward with the explanation:</p>

<p>&#8220;Saxe was sitting here, with his eyes fixed
on the old man&#8217;s manuscript, but with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
mind elsewhere. I was here in my chair,
with all the power of my brain concentrated
on that same manuscript, trying to get some
suggestion for working out the tangle. Was
it merely restlessness under repeated failure,
or was it an instinct that moved me, or just
chance? Anyhow, I got up, and crossed
over to Saxe, and stood looking down at the
music, although I had every line of it clear
in memory&mdash;as clear as the written page
itself. But, this time, in spite of the perfect
recollection I had of it, I saw something
new. That&#8217;s how the thing started. It was
Saxe&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do get on with the explanation,&#8221;
Temple urged. &#8220;What was it I did? I
haven&#8217;t the shadow of an idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simple enough,&#8221; Billy said. &#8220;Just
absent-mindedly, you sat there with a pencil
in your hand, and made ticks over certain
notes. As I looked down at the sheet, my
attention was especially caught by these, for
the excellent reason that they had not been
there before. Without any volition on my
part, I stood there considering the pencil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
marks. Within a half-minute, the great idea
hit me. In the first rush, I was sure it was
the right one; but I wanted to be alone to work
it out. So, I just swooped down on the manuscript,
and carried it off to my room. Now,
to present the case in orderly sequence, here
is what we may term Exhibit A.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy took from his pocket a third sheet,
which he gave to Saxe. This proved to be the
original manuscript of the music, with the
pencil markings made by Saxe. The heir of
Abernethey examined the page closely, but his
expression of bewilderment did not pass. Roy
and David left their places to look over the
other&#8217;s shoulder. For nearly a minute, the
three held their gaze curiously on the sheet.
Then, of one accord, they looked up, to meet
the amused glance of Billy Walker.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; they demanded, in a single voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have observed the pencil marks?&#8221;
came the question; and the three nodded assent.</p>

<p>This is the manner in which the manuscript
had been affected by the absent-minded action
of Saxe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_216.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;In pursuance of the idea that had come to
me,&#8221; Billy continued, &#8220;I next made a tracing.
I took a piece of tissue paper, and laid it over
this manuscript. I could then see quite clearly,
so that it was easy to make the outline I wished.
I started at the beginning, with the notes
checked by Saxe, from which I had received
the hint as to what to do. I started my pencil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
at the first top note in the first line of the
composition. Then, I drew the pencil straight
to the second top note, then on to the third,
and so forth in order. Thus, I drew an irregular
line with the pencil, from one note to
another, using always the highest notes. In
this manner, I drew the line indicated by the
first half of the music, and I liked that so well
that I kept right on, and made the second
irregular line, as indicated by the second half
of the music. By the time this was accomplished,
I was sure that I had finally got the
right idea, and that our victory over the old
man&#8217;s cunning would be won. It was, of
course, obvious that the two irregular lines I
had secured should be joined in one. You have
seen the result. Consider Exhibit B.&#8221; Billy
spread out the two papers showing the outlines
he had drawn, and pointed to that containing
two lines.</p>

<p>It had this appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_217.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Billy completed his account of the matter
with no diminution in his air of elation:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_218.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;Here, then,&#8221; he said, waving aloft Exhibit
C to emphasize his meaning, &#8220;I present to you
the chart which the late Mr. Abernethey left
us as a guide to the spot where the treasure
lies secreted. It is plain enough for even your
eyes to read, I fancy. The pencil outline is to
serve us as a map, which we are to follow to
the gold. It represents&mdash;roughly, I take it&mdash;the
sky-line of the country round about. As
I had only just completed the drawing before
I came back to you, I&#8217;ve had no time to compare
it with the hills hereabouts; but I&#8217;m certain
none the less. It&#8217;s a matter of inference.
There remains now only the task of finding
out what marks the precise point of the hiding-place
on this line. It seems to me that some
one of you with knowledge of music ought to
work out that trifling detail. If not, of course
I can do it&mdash;in time.&#8221;</p>

<small>THE HOLD</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">BILLY&#8217;S vanity was well content with the
compliments accorded him by his friends,
who gave the appreciation that was justly his
due for persistent effort when they had wearied.
It was David whose enthusiasm led him
to suggest an immediate trip on the lake, to
learn whether or not they could identify the
features of the topography shown by the chart.</p>

<p>The launch, to which they had been reduced
by the loss of the <i>Scherzo</i>, had a speed of
twelve miles an hour at its best and under
Jake&#8217;s guidance it carried them swiftly enough
northward to the broadest part of the lake,
whence they might readily study the shore in
all directions. Already, each had familiarized
himself with the chart, so that it was held
clearly in a mental picture, while he looked
about over the sweep of sky-line critically, seeking
some resemblance in the rise and fall of
mountain and hill and in the curving of the
shore to the irregular tracing made by Billy
from the music. As the boat ran in a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
circle, first one and then another caught here
or there some trick of configuration that sent
him eagerly to compare it with the chart in
Billy&#8217;s hands. But, in each instance, the hope
was doomed to swift disappointment, for vital
divergence was revealed between the two.
There was some disagreement, too, as to
whether or not the map had reference to the
windings of the shore, or to the crests and valleys
of the hills and mountains, as they showed
in relief against the sky. Billy Walker was
certain that the chart had been drawn to represent
the sky-line, and Saxe was of the same
opinion&mdash;chiefly, perhaps, because of the other&#8217;s
reasoning in which he had come to have
great confidence, if not absolute reliance. Billy
argued that the sky-line would be the natural
guide on which to depend, inasmuch as it was
bolder, less open to doubts. The indication
received from this, he pointed out, could be
at once applied to the shore, since the first
knowledge gleaned had declared that the treasure
was at the bed of the lake. Both Roy and
David, however, maintained that the chart
should be taken as copying the indentations in
a portion of the shore-line. David offered evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in support of this contention to the effect
that, whatever the sky-line might show as to
itself, there could come from it no hint as to
the distance from the shore at which the gold
was lying. Billy admitted this, and then to his
adversary&#8217;s chagrin, exposed the fact that the
like difficulty must exist in the event of the
map being of the shore-line itself&mdash;which was
not to be gainsaid. It was Saxe, who, at last,
made the discovery of importance. He had
been staring fixedly at one point of the horizon
for a full minute; then, he moved over to
Billy&#8217;s side, where he alternately regarded the
chart and the horizon for a considerable interval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, Billy!&#8221; he exclaimed, abruptly.
&#8220;Just take a squint at Mount Tabor, over
there; I learned the name from Jake the other
day.&#8221; He pointed to the west, a little to the
north of them, where one of the highest of the
peaks of the distant mountains loomed in naked
majesty.</p>

<p>Billy obeyed the request, and readily distinguished
the peak to which Saxe had called
his attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he questioned.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>&#8220;I want you to notice, too,&#8221; Saxe continued,
&#8220;that the peak is flat on the top for some distance,
and that there&#8217;s nothing of much height
to the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy nodded in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, look farther north, about two miles,
or perhaps more. You see another mountain,
which seems to be almost the same height as
Mount Tabor, and is flat on top in the same
way?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was hardly any delay before Billy
answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I see it. Next?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; Saxe continued, with animation,
&#8220;you must bear in mind the fact that those
two peaks are the highest on the whole extent
of the western shore of the lake. It is, I imagine,
very likely that anyone in search for a
striking object in the landscape would select
them at the outset as guides, on account of
their conspicuousness. It&#8217;s my belief, after
looking pretty closely, that Mount Tabor is
shown by the two G&#8217;s above the staff in the beginning
of the gold song. Try it running north
from Mount Tabor, and compare it with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
chart, and see if you don&#8217;t find it brings you
all right to the second high mountain, which
is marked by the two G&#8217;s of the second half of
the music. And then, keep on, until you come
to the mountain top, much lower, but also hog-backed,
which seems to me to be indicated by
the final C&#8217;s of the score.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy needed no urging. Before his friend
had ceased speaking, he had brought his whole
mind to bear in considering the similarities to
which Saxe called his attention. For five minutes,
he examined first the undulant horizon
line and then the chart, which he held out-spread
before him. He and Saxe were in the
stern seats, while Roy and David had places
forward, discussing the shore-line, and giving
no heed to what was going on behind them.
Suddenly, the voice of Billy Walker boomed
forth in its fullness:</p>

<p>&#8220;By Croesus, Saxe, you&#8217;ve got it! You&#8217;ve
pinned the map to the mountains! Bravo, my
son!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the outburst, Roy and David faced about,
startled. They saw the unwieldy bulk of Billy
swaying with the motion he had imparted to
the launch by leaping to his feet. He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
figure of joy, with his little eyes glowing, his
bare head a tangle of wind-tossed hair, his
harsh features softened by radiance. Even
Jake had turned in his seat at the wheel, and
was rigidly expectant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Praise be!&#8221; Billy ejaculated, as he waved
the chart high in a gesture of triumph. &#8220;One
of you, at last, has come to my help. Saxe has
run the chart to earth&mdash;literally.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that, there was a lively display of interest.
Jake stopped the engine, and left the
launch to drift lazily, while he joined the others
for a study of the map in connection with the
horizon line discovered by Saxe. Roy and
David were inclined to be somewhat skeptical
at the outset, but they were presently convinced,
as they perceived the exactness of the
correspondence between mountains and chart.
There was jubilation on the part of all.</p>

<p>Jake introduced a topic that was lying in the
mind of each.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand yet jest where
&#8217;bouts that-thar money of Mr. Abernethey&#8217;s
might be,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;What about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our esteemed friend has touched on the
very <i>crux</i> of the matter,&#8221; Billy declared, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
a noisy sigh. &#8220;We have now attained to all the
knowledge that we require for our purposes&mdash;with
a single small exception&mdash;we don&#8217;t know
where the gold is. Nevertheless, the chart will
tell us. It&#8217;s there&mdash;somewhere&mdash;Saxe has
done nobly in coming to my assistance. It
seems to me that, now, it&#8217;s the turn of either
Roy or Dave.&#8221; Billy laughed, and then
assumed an expression of elephantine demureness.
&#8220;Roy is something of an expert in occult
things,&#8221; he suggested, with his eyes twinkling.
&#8220;It might be a good idea for him to try his
powers on this. The divining rod, in the hands
of the gifted, will locate precious metals, as
well as water, under the surface of the earth.
Doubtless, it will do as much for gold under
water. It is probable that Jake can inform us
as to where witch-hazel is to be found in the
woods. With a twig of that for wand&mdash;I believe
it is the accepted wood&mdash;let Roy go wandering
over the lake in the launch; let him hold
the divining-rod in his hand until it shall dip
toward the water. Let a buoy be floated there
to mark the spot, and there will we dredge, and
there will we bring up the old man&#8217;s treasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy sniffed, while Saxe and David smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
over Billy&#8217;s bombast. But Jake took the suggestion
seriously, and nodded his approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;Allus hearn it would find gold and silver,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but I hain&#8217;t never seen it done. It&#8217;s
fine for water, though, and that I know, havin&#8217;
seen it work many a time. It bent, and they
dug, and the water come, and that&#8217;s all they
was to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two hours after he had retired that night,
Billy Walker was rudely awakened out of a
sound sleep. In a dream, which had been of
a curious, but most agreeable heaven, where
he was dining on dishes that were puzzles, each
one to be solved before it could be eaten, he was
instantaneously transported to a vile groggery
of the water-front in a seaport town, where
a horde of rapscallions pounced on him with
intent to shanghai. He awoke to behold in the
moonlight Saxe, who sat on the edge of the
bed, jolting him violently to and fro. When
his brain was sufficiently clear, he demanded
the meaning of this outrage. The first words
from his friend were consolation enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy, I&#8217;ve found the place!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>There was no need for apology, since the
disturber of his slumbers had brought to Billy
Walker the news he most desired. Instantly,
he was questioning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Tell me! How&#8217;d you find it!
Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe laughed happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must give you one final lesson in music,
to enable you to understand. It&#8217;s so simple! I
can&#8217;t guess why I didn&#8217;t get it in a second.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The most obvious thing is often the most
obscure,&#8221; came the oracular paradox.</p>

<p>&#8220;A hold in music,&#8221; Saxe explained, &#8220;is a
mark which shows that a certain note is to be
sounded for a time longer than is demanded
by its value otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; There was excitement in the harsh
whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait until I&#8217;ve lighted the lamp,&#8221; Saxe
said. In a moment it was done. &#8220;Now, take
another glance at the gold song itself&mdash;not the
chart.&#8221; He pulled the sheet from a pocket of
the dressing-gown that he wore over his
pajamas, and held it up before Billy&#8217;s face for
inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="center">[<a href="music/lake_mystery_music.midi">Listen</a>]</p>


<p>&#8220;That shaded half-circle,&#8221; Saxe went on,
&#8220;with a period in the concavity, over the second
measure of the second half of the gold song, is
a hold&mdash;a hold&mdash;a hold, Billy! Don&#8217;t you understand?
Isn&#8217;t it plain? That marks the spot
where the gold is&mdash;I know it does. That&#8217;s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
place where we pause, where we hang on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course!&#8221; Billy Walker&#8217;s voice had a
tone of complete satisfaction. &#8220;You&#8217;ve done
splendidly, Saxe. With much training, I believe
I might be able to make something out of your
intellect. The chart will show just what part
of the shore is indicated by this hold. The gold
will be at that point&mdash;probably, close to the
bank, but certainly under the water, for the
first lesson read, &#8216;The Bed of the Lake.&#8217; We
shall find it without Roy&#8217;s divining-rod, after
all.&#8221;</p>

<small>MASTERS AGAIN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN THE hour preceding dawn, Roy gave
over his fight against an unaccustomed
nervousness that had kept him awake, rose,
took a sponge bath, shaved, and dressed himself
for the day. He stole from the room, and
quietly let himself out of the house, in confident
expectation that the outdoors charm of
dawn would soothe the unrest of his spirit. A
slight noise arrested his attention as he went
toward the north end of the cottage. He was
wearing tennis shoes, of which the rubber soles
made no sound on the ground, and he went forward
with caution, his curiosity aroused, for
he was certain that he caught a sibilant whisper.
Already, there was a rosy grayness stealing
on the air, so that he could see, though
dimly. As he came to the corner of the house,
he halted, and peered covertly forward. He
could distinguish a shadow that moved a little.
As his eyes grew accustomed to the twilight, he
made out that there were two forms there, one
much the larger. Again, his ears detected a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
faint whispering, too indistinct to be understood.
Then, one softly spoken phrase came
clearly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come away&mdash;they&#8217;ll hear us.&#8221; It was the
voice of the engineer.</p>

<p>Roy&#8217;s muscles tensed for the leap forward.
But he remembered the fact that as yet there
was nothing in the way of direct evidence
against Masters. He and his friends believed
in the man&#8217;s guilt, but there was no proof. Now
something might be said that would serve to
convict the engineer of his crimes. Roy determined
to listen, to learn what he might.
The two who had met thus mysteriously moved
toward the north-east, going swiftly toward the
shore of the lake. At a safe distance behind
them, Roy followed.</p>

<p>The couple halted in an open place on the
lake shore, where a cliff dropped sheer to the
water some thirty feet, as much more to the
bottom of the lake. Roy contrived to make a
slow progress to a point in the undergrowth
above them, hardly a rod away, and here he
was able to understand every word spoken between
them. And now, fire of wrath, kindled
by jealousy, burned fiercely in Roy&#8217;s bosom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
for there came to him the voice of the smaller
of the two persons, and it was the voice of a
girl&mdash;the voice of May Thurston. Strangely,
the idea that she could be the one thus to meet
the engineer by stealth had not occurred to him
hitherto, and the shock of the discovery came
near to robbing him of his self-control. Indeed
he made a movement to dart forth, but
again his action was checked by the command
of reason, though through evil seconds he
fought against obedience. Then abruptly, his
mood changed as he caught the significance of
the dialogue between the speakers:</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it was you,&#8221; May was saying, in a
voice vibrant with horror, which she strove to
repress. &#8220;I knew it was you that first time,
for I went up there, and found the rifle in the
tree where you had been when I met you in the
morning. I supposed, of course, that you
understood how I knew, and so you wouldn&#8217;t
dare to try again. And I thought you had
gone. Thank God, I couldn&#8217;t sleep tonight, and
came out in time to see you light that fuse&mdash;in
time to put it out before you could stop me.
I shall tell them everything in the morning, the
first thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>There was a note of finality in her voice. It
was evident that whatever tenderness she had
felt for this man had been overwhelmed beneath
the flood of her loathing for his crimes.
Masters must have understood perfectly the
uselessness of all effort to persuade her from
her purpose, for he wasted not an instant in
argument; instead, he acted.</p>

<p>Before Roy could make a movement to interfere,
the engineer had leaped forward. His
long, powerful fingers closed in a strangling
grasp on the soft, white throat of the girl,
sank viciously into the tender flesh. May&#8217;s
eyes protruded, her arms straightened out in
a spasm of physical anguish, but no sound
issued from the parted lips. Almost in the
same second, Masters shifted his grip with
lightning speed to her waist, lifted her easily,
and swung her from the cliff out into space.
Then, he went crashing off into the wood, running
blindly, ere yet came the splash made by
the girl&#8217;s falling body as it entered the water.</p>

<p>Perhaps Masters did not hear the second
splash, which followed after the briefest interval.
If he heard, and thought of it at all, he
probably deemed it caused by some rock his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
movement had set rolling over the cliff. Assuredly,
he never dreamed that there had been at
hand a man to plunge after his victim, to save
her from the death to which he had assigned
her. In his intimacy with May, he had learned
that she could not swim. In that deep water,
where the naked cliff rising vertically offered
no hand-hold, she, in her dazed condition, could
have no chance to escape alive out of the peril
into which his cruelty had cast her. Such was
the engineer&#8217;s belief, and his feeling was
merely of satisfaction in thus having rid himself
of the witness who knew his blood-guiltiness.</p>

<p>Even as his body clove the air in the long
dive to the water, Roy was conscious of a pang
of regret that he must suffer the enemy to
escape. Then, he was beneath the surface,
groping vainly. As his head shot clear again,
his eyes glimpsed May&#8217;s head just disappearing
near at hand. In a moment, he had reached
her, was in time to seize her before she
sank again. He was at home in the element,
and, as the girl was unconscious, and so
offered no resistance by a struggle, his task was
all the easier. He quickly brought her to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
shore, at a point where there was a break in
the cliff, and the ground sloped sharply to the
level above. He did not pause until he had
carried her in his arms to the top of the bank.
There, he laid her face downward on the
ground, then lifted her by the waist, so that
the lungs might empty themselves of water.
Afterward, he chafed her face and hands, and
soon, to his great relief, she showed signs of
returning consciousness. As she had been immersed
for so brief a time, she speedily made
a complete recovery, save for the weakness
consequent to the shock of the whole experience.
Indeed, her wretchedness was rather
from the violence of the engineer&#8217;s attack than
from the little water she had swallowed before
her rescue by Roy.</p>

<p>It was after the first confused questioning on
her part, and Roy&#8217;s account of his presence
on the scene, that she gave an explanation of
the events that had led to the attempt against
her life. She, too, had sought relief from
wearisome wakefulness by wandering abroad
in the night. While she was close to the cottage,
yet in the shadows of the wood, she had heard
a sound that attracted her attention, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
watched carefully. There was a long silence
before her interest was rewarded, but at last,
she made out a movement on the north wall of
the cottage itself, which was only a little way
from her. Observing closely, she perceived
that the object was a man, who was descending
a ladder. It needed no more to fill her with
alarm, and with fear came suspicion, which
was almost certainty, as to the identity
of the prowler. At first, however, she
remained quiescent, doubtful as to her right
course of conduct, anxious, if it were in any
wise possible, to avoid alarming the household.
During her period of delay, the man
disappeared with the ladder, but he returned
immediately, and forthwith she saw a match
struck. It was extinguished at once, but, as
the flame died out, she beheld a glowing spark,
which remained against the wall. Even as she
stared, it seemed to mount upward very slowly.
She believed, then, that the desperate man had
determined to set the cottage on fire, and a new
horror gripped her, so that the scream she attempted
did not pass her lips. In an instant,
she had reached the cottage&mdash;she caught the
spark between her palms, and smothered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the fire. Before she had time to understand
the situation, she was hurled backward,
and found herself in the arms of
Masters, who was whispering fiercely in her
ear to be silent. Without giving him any heed
at first, she mechanically examined her
smudged hands, and found that she held in
them the charred end of a cord. As she drew
the length of this to her, it came readily, and
she was aware that it had broken from its
fastening under the impact of the man&#8217;s leap
on her. She knew, also, that this thing she was
holding was a fuse. Her quick intelligence
grasped the truth that the treacherous engineer,
who now embraced her so roughly, had
again sought to destroy his enemies. She was
so agitated by the realization, so distraught by
the thought that she was lying helpless within
the criminal&#8217;s arms, while he held a hand over
her mouth to silence her shrieks, that she even
welcomed the suggestion overheard by Roy as
to their moving to a greater distance from the
cottage. The remainder of the incident was
already known to her savior.</p>

<p>As she ended her story, May, overwrought,
began crying softly. There are times when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
simplicity of direct physical contact avails
more than any magic of words to tell sympathy
and love. It was so in this instance. Wet and
bedraggled as he was from his descent into the
lake, Roy drew into his arms the crouched form
of the girl, and held her closely, while from
them the rivulets slid silently away downward,
to seek again the lake from which they had
been ravished. The girl was first startled, then
soothed, then wondrously content. The dawn
came, stealing softly, and the light fell on them
as a blessing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>DUX FACTI FEMINA</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ROY was aroused to sudden consternation,
when a lull in his ecstatic emotion let him
once again think of mundane things, for it
flashed on him that the explosive to which the
fuse had been attached still remained in Saxe&#8217;s
chamber. In a word he explained the matter,
and the two hastened to the cottage, where
after a quick embrace they separated, May going
to her room, to change into dry clothing,
and Roy running to his friend. He entered
Saxe&#8217;s chamber cautiously, yet moving rapidly,
lighted the lamp, and looked about him. At
once, his eyes fell on the bomb, which rested on
a bureau, near the head of the bed. From it
extended the remnant of fuse, which ran out
through the open window. Roy drew this in,
took up the bomb carefully, for he was not sure
how sensitive it might be, and made his way
out of the room, without awakening the
sleeper. Within a minute, the instrument of
crime was reposing innocuously on the bed of
the lake, whither Roy had tossed it from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
cliff. On his return to the house, he aroused
his friend, and told of the latest attempt on the
part of the engineer. Saxe was profoundly
impressed by the narrowness of his escape
from death, or mutilation. Nevertheless, his
feeling was less by far than it must have been,
but for his midnight discovery concerning the
miser&#8217;s cipher. Without pausing to dress, he
hurriedly related the fact to Roy, who was
equally impressed. To make the matter wholly
clear, Saxe would have exhibited the music to
Roy, showing the place occupied by the hold,
but the manuscript had mysteriously disappeared.
The two hunted through the room
thoroughly, although Saxe was sure that the
sheet had been left on the bureau when he
returned from Billy Walker&#8217;s room. There
was no trace of it anywhere, and presently they
abandoned the search, to stare at each other in
bewilderment. It was Roy who first reached
a solution of the puzzle:</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Masters took it&mdash;of course!&#8221; he
declared, savagely. &#8220;He&#8217;s been snooping
around, heard us talk of it probably, and, when
he got here tonight, he simply swiped it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;ll do him no good.&#8221; Saxe protested.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>&#8220;But he thinks it will,&#8221; Roy retorted. &#8220;Anyhow,
he&#8217;s made off with it. Perhaps he thought
it would tie us up&mdash;and so it will. We must
have it back.&#8221; His jaw shot forward, and his
eyes grew hard.</p>

<p>Saxe, however, smiled, and shook his head
in denial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; he asserted. &#8220;I can reproduce
that music in ten minutes, every mark on
it. I know where the hold was, exactly. For
that matter, I don&#8217;t need the music. The chart
will do just as well, for I know the place on it,
too. But I&#8217;ll do the music over for Bill and
the rest of you. I&#8217;ll do it as soon as I&#8217;m
dressed, before I come down to breakfast.&#8221;
And as he said, so was it. When he appeared
at the breakfast-table, he carried with him an
exact duplicate of the old miser&#8217;s manuscript.</p>

<p>There was much lively interest on the part
of all, when the adventure of the night was
made known, and May on her appearance was
hailed as a heroine of melodrama. To the
astonishment of all save Roy perhaps, the girl
was more radiant than they had ever seen her
hitherto, and the color in her cheeks and the
brilliance of her charming eyes, now undisfigured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
by the businesslike lenses of the secretary,
rendered her beauty so striking that the men
regarded her with new admiration, while
Margaret West, from the instinct of a woman
whose own heart is full of tenderness,
regarded her friend with a gentle suspicion
that there remained something of the adventure
yet untold.</p>

<p>Roy was eager to devote the day to a search
for the capture of Masters, but the others were
opposed to this. It was finally decided that the
quest for the hiding-place of the treasure must
be carried on without a moment of delay, since
the matter of the short time now remaining,
only a week, could not be ignored. As to the
evil devices of the engineer, it would be sufficient
to take precautions against them by keeping
watch through the coming night and afterward
until the end of the hunt for the gold.
So, as soon as breakfast was done, the four
friends set out in the launch with Jake for a
survey of the territory indicated by the hold.</p>

<p>This, as was clearly apparent from examination
of the manuscript, was on the lake
shore at a point opposite one of the low peaks.
It was easily distinguished by its nearness to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the second of the highest summits, as it was at
the first point of rise after a long descent. The
course brought them again to the north end of
the lake, to a place close to the extreme end.
There was a cove here, which ran inland for a
half-mile. Within the curve of the shore, a
few small islands were scattered, and outside
the miniature bay a larger island stretched,
one of the chief on the lake.</p>

<p>It was Roy who now assumed charge of the
expedition, by right of his varied experience
in wild places, which had included the tracking
of cattle-rustlers and outlaws. He directed
that first a landing should be made, and the
shore at the point indicated gone over carefully
for any slightest trace of footsteps, or other
marks, which might show operations in connection
with the removal of the treasure. If
found, such a trail would doubtless guide them
in their further quest of the gold at the bottom
of the lake. They spent three hours at the
work, and finally abandoned it in despair, for
their investigation had been exhaustive, without
revealing aught.</p>

<p>Billy Walker delivered himself forcibly,
when at last a council was called. Since he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
toiled steadfastly with the others, notwithstanding
his distaste for physical exertion,
there could be no question as to his sincerity
when he argued against any further effort in
this direction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned from Jake,&#8221; he explained,
&#8220;that the late Mr. Abernethey understood the
management of his boats perfectly, and on occasion
used them without taking any one along
to help him. It is, therefore, reasonable to
suppose that he would have transported the
money to its hiding-place in one of the power-boats.
He had no horse, and his feebleness
was such that he could not have lugged all that
weight of gold, even if he divided it into small
amounts, for this place is four miles from the
cottage&mdash;almost as far as we walked the other
day. Now, we know that the treasure is at
the bottom of the lake. That was the first
thing the manuscript taught us. I&#8217;m sure he
brought it here in the boat. There is no reason
why there should be any mark on the
shore. I say this: We&#8217;ll go back, and have
luncheon. Then, we&#8217;ll return here, and institute
an orderly, exhaustive search of the lake
bottom. We must rig up some sort of grappling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
irons, and anyone so wishing can become
a diver, and search the bottom that way. Anyhow,
we know the gold is down there. It&#8217;s up
to us to find it. I will say, I think the old man
has done his part.&#8221;</p>

<p>This plan was duly carried out. As soon
as the young men had left the luncheon-table,
they scattered to gather the necessary materials
for their equipment in the next stage of the
undertaking, following the suggestions of Billy
Walker.</p>

<p>Saxe had just descended the steps of the
porch when he heard his name called. He
turned, and saw Margaret West, standing
half-way between him and the shore, a little to
the south from the cottage. At the moment,
there was no one else visible. Saxe hurried
toward her, his face flushed with pleasure at
the summons. Recently, she had seemed a bit
more distant in her attitude toward him, and he
had been tortured by those alarms that are the
heritage of all lovers. At this moment, however,
her face was radiant, and her limpid blue
eyes were sparkling with eagerness. As he came
near, she spoke, and there was a thrill of delight
in her voice, which set his heart bounding.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she said, clasping her hands on her
breast in a quaint gesture of emotion, &#8220;I hope,
I really believe that I may be able to help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Saxe exclaimed, in manifest surprise.
&#8220;Why, what do you mean? Help me&mdash;how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the gold,&#8221; Margaret answered.
There was timidity in her tones now, as if his
evidence of astonishment had distressed her.
&#8220;I think, I&#8217;m almost sure, that I know something
you ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe&#8217;s amazement increased. Somehow, at
the back of his mind, there had always lingered
the abominable statement made by Roy as to
this girl, that she was his natural enemy, that
she must be such by the circumstances of the
case, since his success would be her direct loss
of a large sum of money. He had scorned the
idea when it was presented to him; he had
never for a moment allowed it entertainment;
his love for the girl was sufficient to deny the
possibility of her being in any way influenced
by sordid things. Yet, always, the thought had
lurked in the background for the reason that it
had once been voiced by his friend. Now, at
her display of interest in his behalf, his first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
emotion was wholly of surprise from the unexpectedness
of the event, and this was followed
swiftly by joy that thus she should have
proved Roy&#8217;s saying false. The new feeling
was undoubtedly shown in his face, for, as she
regarded him intently, Margaret&#8217;s expression
grew lighter again. She went on speaking
with new animation:</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I was here once before, when I
was a little girl, visiting my cousin. He was
different then&mdash;not lively, or gay, or anything
like that, but I don&#8217;t think that the miserliness
had got such a hold on him. Anyhow, he went
about with me a great deal, and we really had
ever so good times together. He often took
me out in the launch. One time in particular
is the thing I must speak to you about, for he
took me up in the neighborhood where you
were today. I&#8217;m sure of that, for I know just
where you went from what you said at luncheon.
Do you wish me to go on?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I wish you to?&#8221; Saxe cried. &#8220;We need
all the help we can get. Of course I wish you
to. The only thing is that I wonder you&#8217;re
willing. It doesn&#8217;t seem right that you should
rob yourself by giving assistance to your natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
enemies.&#8221; He smiled whimsically, as he
thus paraphrased Roy&#8217;s accusation against the
girl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; was her energetic retort. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not quite so poor as to worry over the money
part of it. It seems to me that you ought to
win&mdash;I think my cousin meant you to. Besides,
I&#8217;d like to see you do it, just to disappoint Mr.
Masters. But let me tell you, I&#8217;m still afraid
of him. He&#8217;s a desperate man, who&#8217;ll stop at
nothing, even murder, as you know. And he&#8217;s
mad to get that money. So, I want to help you,
and to beat him. But, of course, my idea may
amount to nothing, really&mdash;after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; Saxe said, simply. He was beamingly
happy, and the fact showed plainly
enough in his eyes and smile. The girl flushed
a little under his glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an island up there,&#8221; she said presently;
and her voice was strangely soft for a
statement so prosaic. &#8220;It lies in the entrance
to the cove, before you come to the other
islands. They are smaller, too. You noticed
it, perhaps?&#8221; She glanced up at Saxe inquiringly,
then her eyes drooped again, as he
nodded assent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>&#8220;That,&#8221; she continued briskly, &#8220;was one of
the places to which my cousin took me. What
I learned that day may be just the thing you
need to know now: There&#8217;s a cave on that
island.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe regarded the girl in dismay. This information
was not what he had anticipated.
He did not know just what he had expected,
but certainly it had been nothing like this.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cave!&#8221; he exclaimed, weakly. &#8220;But the
gold&#8217;s at the bottom of the lake, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret moved her head in assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; she agreed. She was not in
the least disconcerted by the obvious disappointment
on the part of her listener. On the
contrary, a mischievous dimple pitted the rose
of her cheek. &#8220;Just the same, the cave might
have something to do with your affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Saxe objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;The cave runs downward,&#8221; she said; and
she waited for the meaning of her words to
penetrate his consciousness. They did so,
presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, the cave runs downward,&#8221; he repeated,
thoughtfully. &#8220;I begin to understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret met his gaze frankly, and nodded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
assent to the idea that had arisen in his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;the cave is really
larger than you might fancy from the size of
the island, and the passage slopes downward,
though not very steeply. We didn&#8217;t go far. I
don&#8217;t know the length of it. Cousin Horace
didn&#8217;t know&mdash;then. In the cave, there are
plenty of places where the gold could have been
hidden. So, I thought I&#8217;d tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless your dear heart!&#8221; Saxe cried. &#8220;I
believe you&#8217;ve saved the day for us. The
chances are, we&#8217;d never have got to searching
the island even, without your help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You might have missed the cave, if you had
gone over the island,&#8221; Margaret said. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t
at all easy to find, I can tell you. I don&#8217;t know
how my cousin happened on it. He told me
that, as far as he knew, there was no one else
aware of its existence.&#8221;</p>

<p>A great volume of sound shattered the air.
The two turned toward the boat-house, and
saw Billy Walker, who made an imperative
gesture, and shouted again:</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready! Hurry along!&#8221;</p>

<p>But, as Saxe turned to the girl, to say good-bye,
she stayed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; she commanded. &#8220;I don&#8217;t wish the
others to know&mdash;yet. You see, it might come
to nothing, after all. How would it do, if I
were to go with you in the canoe? Then we
could land on the island, and investigate, and
afterward, if you found things promising, you
could tell the others. What do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe was in a whirl of delight. Thus far,
he had never enjoyed the like opportunity to
be with the girl whom he loved. His heart
leaped at the thought of it, and his eyes were
tender and happy as they met hers.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do I think of it?&#8221; he repeated. His
voice was so charged with adoration that the
rich color flooded Margaret&#8217;s cheeks. &#8220;Why,
I think it will be splendid! Shall we start right
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl laughed, in some confusion, and her
glance wandered from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not this very second,&#8221; she protested, &#8220;for I
must change into something different for paddling.
Go down and send the others along, and
I&#8217;ll be with you in ten minutes&mdash;no, fifteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe, waiting on the dock with the canoe
already launched, smiled a trifle grimly, and
admitted that the dearest woman in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was essentially feminine, for his watch indicated
the half-hour since their parting. It was
just as he slipped the timepiece back into his
pocket that he heard the laughing voice behind
him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just on time to the second, am I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe turned, to see Margaret, in workman-like
gray sweater and short skirt. His gaze,
though fond, was mildly reproachful.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been just half an hour,&#8221; he declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m on time, to the second as I said.&#8221;
The girl beamed on him, quite unabashed.</p>

<p>At this astonishing statement, Saxe opened
his eyes in wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you said&mdash;&#8221; he began.</p>

<p>&#8220;I said fifteen minutes,&#8221; Margaret interrupted.
&#8220;Of course, you know that you must
always double a woman&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know,&#8221; the young man confessed,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Margaret continued, as she knelt in
the bow of the canoe. &#8220;The time estimated
must always be doubled. The trouble is that
some women make the time triple, or worse,
with no certainty about it. They bring the sex
into disrepute, and we others, who are exact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
get included in the general condemnation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe, in the stern, watched the graceful
swing of the girl&#8217;s arms as they plied the paddle,
the litheness of the slender body as it
swayed slightly to and fro, watched the sheen
of the sunlight that touched to new glories the
gold of her hair, watched the wonderful curve
of white, softly radiant from the pulsing blood
beneath, which ran from the low neck of the
sweater to lose itself within the wind-tendriled,
shimmering splendor of her locks. And she,
this girl so magically beautiful, so wholesomely
sweet, so divinely complex, so heavenly simple,
this adorable creature had come to aid him at
her own loss&mdash;she, his natural enemy!</p>

<p>They came at last to the island, where the
canoe was beached on a sandy slope. The
launch was out of sight, somewhere beyond
the islands, within the cove. Margaret led the
way without hesitation up the steep ascent that
lined the shore, and then over a boulder-strewn
level toward the center of the island. Presently,
the ground became uneven, with sharp
rises, and gullies running between these.
Within the ravines, there were small cliffs,
rugged, disposed topsy-turvily. Saxe began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to see the possibility of caverns within the confusion
of stone.</p>

<p>Finally, the girl halted, and looked about her
dubiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite sure,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;There
have been landmarks all the way, until just
here. But I think this is the ravine&mdash;if not,
it&#8217;s close by.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on slowly, with roving eyes. Then,
of a sudden, her expression lightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I know now,&#8221; she exclaimed joyously.
&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s here&mdash;see!&#8221; While speaking, she
had hastened forward, and now, as she finished,
she pointed to where a clump of bushes
grew against the north cliff of the ravine.
Above the tops of the branches showed a rift
in the stone. It was less than a foot in width,
a splotch of blackness hardly more noticeable
than a deeper shadow. Saxe, beholding, was
filled with gratitude to his guide.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d never have found it in a thousand
years,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Besides, why should we
ever hunt for the bed of a lake on the top of
an island?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Walker would have evolved a reason
for it in the course of time,&#8221; Margaret said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in a voice charged with profound respect for
the sage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe Billy would have worked it
out&mdash;in time,&#8221; Saxe agreed. &#8220;But,&#8221; he added,
with a smile, &#8220;perhaps not in time&mdash;according
to the terms of the will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s another entrance, on one of the
ridges near the shore,&#8221; Margaret explained.
&#8220;Cousin Horace stumbled on that first. He
showed it to me. But he found this way out,
and it is better. He said the other was very
hard climbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two had gone forward, and now they
were close to the cliff, beside the bushes.
Here, Margaret thrust aside the branches, and,
advancing a step behind them, showed the
entrance to the cave, which was a slit less than
a yard in width at the base, narrowing to the
apex a rod above. It yawned blackly. Saxe
was reminded that he had taken no thought as
to the need of candles or lantern. He began
the confession of his carelessness, but the girl
stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought a pocket-torch,&#8221; she said. &#8220;See!&#8221;
As she spoke, she drew the tube from a pocket
of her sweater, pressed the spring, and lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
up the entrance to the cave.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a girl you are!&#8221; Saxe cried. There
was that in his voice which set Margaret
a-tremble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she commanded hastily. With the
word, she walked forward into the cavern.
Behind her in the narrow passage, Saxe followed
obediently.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>IN THE CAVERN</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE passage continued of limited width
for a number of rods. The floor lay
almost level, smooth enough to make going
easy. The light from the torch showed only
walls of bare rock on either side, and once,
when Margaret turned the rays upward, the
narrowing slant to an apex far above their
heads. The two explorers went in silence.
Saxe thought the footing safe enough so that
he could content himself with watching the
girl, whose every motion was a delight to him,
seen dimly in the glow that penetrated from
without. He was not minded to waste many
glances on barren cliffs, while so much of living
beauty went in buoyant grace there before him.
Margaret, however, gave no apparent attention
to aught save the immediate business of
the moment, which was holding her gaze to
the path lighted by the torch. And so they
came presently into a spacious chamber within
the earth.</p>

<p>As the two entered here, Margaret halted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and Saxe eagerly stepped to her side. The girl
flashed the torch here and there, to reveal the
nature of the place. Saxe guessed that the
room had a diameter of about fifty feet. The
walls of ragged rock formed an uneven circle.
They bent inward in the ascent, with a dome-like
effect, to a height of hardly two score feet.</p>

<p>Margaret wasted no time. After one examination
of the walls by the torch, she fixed the
light on a portion of the side opposite them, a
little to the left. Saxe, peering intently in
this direction, thought that he detected two
patches of shadow, a little denser than the surrounding
dark, which might be the openings
into other tunnels. The girl&#8217;s words proved
his surmise right.</p>

<p>&#8220;There are two passages over there, close
together,&#8221; she announced. &#8220;As I remember,
the one we followed was that on the right. Of
course, the money might be hidden anywhere.
But we might go a little way in that passage
first, so that you&#8217;ll understand how it runs
downward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Saxe agreed. &#8220;The place in which
to search is narrowed by the statement in the
cipher about the bottom of the lake. Does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
other passage, too, run downward?&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl shook her head instinctively,
although the action was not visible, since the
outdoor light did not penetrate thus far, and
the beam cast by the torch was directed from
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing of the second passage,&#8221; she
explained. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t enter it. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>They set out across the chamber, walking
side by side, and so came to the passage-way of
which Margaret had had experience. This
proved to be somewhat broader than that
through which they had come. They had
advanced but a very short way, when the floor
began to slope sharply downward. Saxe realized
that this rate of descent need not be continued
long to bring them to the level of the
lake&#8217;s bottom. He knew that the highest point
of the island could have hardly more than a
hundred feet of elevation above the surface of
the lake. Indeed, he was sure that the entrance
to the cavern was only a little distance above
the level of the water. They had climbed the
bluff that lined the shore, and had afterward
ascended a few slight rises, but the total vertical
height could not have been more than fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
feet. The inclination of the passage downward
was enough to overcome this speedily, if
it should continue. And it did continue, for
such a long way that at last Saxe was sure the
waters of the lake lay above them.</p>

<p>The two wayfarers within this secret place
of the earth spoke little, and that for the most
part of the things immediately about them.
The floor of this passage-way here was not
free from rubble, as the other had been. It
was littered everywhere with fallen fragments,
so that there was need to watch each step with
care. Saxe experienced a new happiness when
the difficulties of the path became so serious as
to justify him in taking the hand of Margaret
to help her in surmounting a fallen boulder.
As the pulse of her blood touched his, it
throbbed a rapture in his heart. In this dark
vault of the earth, he forgot the first object of
the subterranean wandering&mdash;forgot in worship
of the woman at his side; Margaret herself
sharply recalled him to the prosaic.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you notice the difference in the light?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s dying out. It must
need recharging. We must hurry back.&#8221;</p>

<p>A note of apprehension in the speaker&#8217;s voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
aroused Saxe to instant concern. He gave a
quick glance toward the circle of light cast by
the torch, and perceived that its radiance had
in fact grown less.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;it&#8217;s failing. We must
turn. Anyhow, I&#8217;ve seen enough to understand
that this is the likeliest place in which
to hunt for the gold.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke, they turned about together, and
began the ascent with hastening steps, for the
thought that the torch might die out while
they were still within the cavern was far from
pleasant to either of them. The girl&#8217;s anxiety
was revealed in the next question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you matches?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a start of dismay, Saxe recalled that
he had left his match-safe in the pocket of his
coat, which remained in the canoe. Nevertheless,
he made a perfunctory search.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted reluctantly; &#8220;I left them
in the canoe.&#8221; He heard the girl sigh; but she
said nothing more, only hastened her steps.
The dimming of the torch was very apparent
now.</p>

<p>The two scrambled over the unevennesses of
the passage with what haste they might. Saxe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
congratulated himself on the fact that there
had been no other passages branching from
that in which they had made the descent, for
the turns, while never sharp, had been frequent
enough to breed perilous confusion were
there need of choice. In the next instant, however,
he remembered the abstraction of his
thoughts during the traversing of the route,
and he was filled with self-reproach at the
realization that, after all, there might have
been such branches. And, just then, the two
halted abruptly, arrested by a sudden consciousness
of the truth. They were descending!</p>

<p>For a moment, neither spoke. In that little
interval, the feeble glow of the torch died out
altogether.</p>

<p>There came a gasp of dismay from Margaret.
Saxe&#8217;s clasp on her hand tightened in
the instinct of protection. Then he essayed a
cheerful laugh, albeit there was small merriment
in it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he declared briskly, &#8220;we must stop
right where we are until we&#8217;ve planned a campaign.
This is a real adventure.&#8221; Even as he
spoke, miserably aware of the serious predicament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
into which the going out of the torch had
plunged them, he was conscious of the delicate
fragrance of her hair, so near his lips, and the
vague, yet penetrant, perfume that exhaled
from her to the ravishing of his senses. He
fought manfully against the temptation to
draw her to his breast, as every fibre of him
besought. Under the stress of desire denied,
his voice came with a ring of imperiousness.
&#8220;I had a lot of experiences in caves, when I
was a boy. This thing will be easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re going downward,&#8221; Margaret
faltered. The mystery of the event had sapped
courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; Saxe conceded. &#8220;Somewhere,
we turned off into a branch passage. Did you
know of any branch?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; came the answer. The inflection of
distress gave new strength to the temptation
that beset him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have noticed it on the way down,&#8221;
Saxe confessed, in great bitterness of spirit;
&#8220;but my mind was wool-gathering.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl ventured no question. Perhaps she
guessed the nature of that distraction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyhow, we&#8217;ve managed to leave the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
in which we came down. We couldn&#8217;t
have turned around in it, without knowing the
fact. It seems to me that we&#8217;ve only to face
about, and make our way upward again&mdash;merely
watching out that we don&#8217;t get switched
off another time. The ascent will surely take
us back by one or the other of the two corridors
into the big room above.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;if it should not!&#8221; Margaret stammered.
The woe in her voice was pitiful.
&#8220;Why, we might&mdash;here in the dark&mdash;no light&mdash;no
food&mdash;oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Saxe spoke with a manner of authority:</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop! Don&#8217;t imagine things. Worry
wastes strength. Save yours for this exciting
climb through the dark. There&#8217;s no danger&mdash;that
I know.&#8221; The calm confidence with
which he contrived to charge his voice soothed
the girl, and restored to her some measure
of courage. From his position on the left side
of her, he put out his free hand, and touched
the wall. &#8220;Put out your right hand,&#8221; he bade
her, &#8220;until it reaches the wall. Now, we&#8217;ll turn
round, and begin the journey in the right direction.
Keep in touch with the wall, please.
Move slowly, using your feet in place of eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to avoid stumbling.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this fashion, they set forth through the
blackness of the cavern. It was slow and tedious
going. It had been tiresome enough when
the torch made plain the obstacles strewn over
the floor. Now, the difficulties were multiplied
an hundredfold by the absence of light. They
could only shuffle a foot about cautiously until
it secured a firm place, then by like clumsy
feeling choose the next step. Often, one or
the other stumbled, was near to falling, but,
since these mishaps occurred rarely at the same
instant, the one still in balance gave sufficient
support. Yet, slow as was their progress, Saxe
found heart to be content with it. Always it
was upward, until he dared believe that they
were actually in either the passage by which
they had descended, or in that which opened
near it in the big room. He told his faith to
Margaret, and she strove her best to throw off
the gloom bred of this hateful environment, but
could not; nevertheless, despite her fears, they
won through at last to the great chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; cried Saxe. His guiding left
hand swept suddenly into emptiness&mdash;another
step, and still there had been no contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to his roving fingers. It was then that
he halted, and gave a shout of triumph.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no wall on your side?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>The girl put out her hand, but there was
nothing within reach. With a pang of compunction,
she realized that she had been
remiss in the duty appointed her, for she had
not felt the wall even once in a long while.
She made admission of her guilt, with charming
contrition.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no matter,&#8221; Saxe declared. Profound
relief sounded in his words. &#8220;We&#8217;ve come
safe to the big room, and nothing else
counts.&#8221; In sheer exuberance over their
escape, he pressed the fingers that lay so
lightly within his.</p>

<p>The girl thrilled in answer to the clasp.
The announcement of their return to the
chamber came to her overwrought mind as
a reprieve from fearful doom. With the joy
now possessing her, there came relaxation
of the tension that had sustained her. In
the warm pressure of his hand over hers was
a comfort that loosed the self-control in
which she had held herself hitherto. Without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
any warning, she drooped as she stood;
her form grew limp. She would have fallen,
had not Saxe, in terror for her as he felt the
yielding of her muscles, drawn her to his
breast. He held her close there. It seemed
strange to him, as she lay motionless within
his embrace, the while his lips touched softly
a strand of the wonderful hair, that the glory
of those tresses should not make all things
visibly radiant in the blackness of the cavern,
even as the nearness of her made a golden
sunlight in his heart. He did not utter a
word or venture aught beyond the kiss on
that lock which kindliest fate had laid across
his lips&mdash;only rested motionless, holding her
firmly, reverently, what time she wept softly
on his bosom. Surely, there needed no
clumsy vehicle of words between those two
embraced in the solitary dark. Twain pulses
throbbed as one. In their rhythm ran a song
of heavenly things.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THE EVENTS OF A NIGHT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">SINCE the large chamber was in utter
darkness, Saxe decided on recourse to
a device which had served him well in similar
situations of his boyhood among the
mountains. As soon as Margaret moved
and drew a little away from him, he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must step back to the passage-way,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;From it, I can take our bearings,
so that we can cross the place without
floundering about haphazard in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the girl answered. Her voice came
very low, quavering a little.</p>

<p>Two paces brought them again to the
entrance of the corridor. There, with a hand
touching either side, Saxe made sure of the
exact direction in which he faced, and from
this he judged his course, for he remembered
the relative positions of the passage by
which they had come into the big room and
of the shadows he had seen on the opposite
wall. He had in mind as well his estimate of
the diameter of the chamber, and so, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
had made sure of his direction he set off boldly,
after again taking Margaret by the hand. He
lengthened his stride a trifle, to make it the
measure of a pace. When he had counted fifteen
steps, he reduced his speed, and moved
with caution, groping before him. A moment
later, his hands encountered the wall. He
was confident that he had held his course
fairly straight in crossing the chamber, and
was certain, in consequence, that the opening
into the passage must lie a little to his
left. He therefore drew Margaret in this
direction. An instant later, to his joy, his
left hand found emptiness. Without a word,
the two hurried forward, and presently they
saw before them a dim glow that was the
first hint of outer light. Saxe fell behind
the girl as the passage narrowed. Margaret
quickened her steps to a run, and he held fast
at her heels. In the same second with her,
he issued from the cavern, and sent forth a
huge shout, which was a little for escape
from the cave, but chiefly for a primitive,
masterful delight in the woman beside him.
Margaret smiled sympathy with his mood&mdash;and
her smile, it may be, was divided in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
sources, even as was the lover&#8217;s cry of
triumph.</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s face was mantled with blushes.
But she spoke bravely, with a dainty air of
inconsequence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how late it is!&#8221; She pointed
toward the west. &#8220;See, the sun has set
already, we were in there for ages.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Saxe agreed. &#8220;And it&#8217;s like rebirth
to come back&mdash;rebirth into a new, glorious
life.&#8221; With an effort, he checked himself,
for he would not embarrass her now, though
passion bubbled to his lips. &#8220;We must paddle
over to where the rest are, and let them
know about the cave at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>The news brought by the two created a
lively excitement among the others, along
with a considerable feeling of relief, for the
continued absence of Margaret and Saxe had
been inexplicable, until Billy Walker quoted,
with ostentatious carelessness:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>Love&#8217;s a virtue for heroes&mdash;as white as the snow on high hills,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>And immortal as every great soul is that struggles, endures and fulfills.</i></div>
</div></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>At this utterance from the seer, who was
by no means prone to sentimental rhapsodizing,
Roy appeared at first puzzled, then
enlightened, and he smiled&mdash;nor speculated
more as to the whereabouts of his missing
friend, while David grinned appreciatively,
and accepted the innuendo as a sufficient
explanation of Saxe&#8217;s absence even in this
crisis of affairs.</p>

<p>For the rest, the three, with some assistance
from Jake, had passed a busy afternoon,
without accomplishing anything beyond a
disheartening certainty that the gold had
been very effectually concealed. Much of
the cove was shallow, and Billy Walker had
suited his convenience by pursuing his investigations
of these portions from the launch
which Jake guided to and fro as required.
The clearness of the water made it possible
to see the bottom distinctly except at the
greatest depths, and in this comfortable
fashion Billy conducted his search, smoking
the inevitable black cigar. In the deeper
parts, Roy, clad in a bathing-suit, made such
examination of the bottom as he might by
diving. David either assisted Billy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
scrutiny from the launch, or hunted over the
islands near the shore. At no time did it
occur to them to extend their researches so
far as the island on which Saxe and Margaret
had landed. They had just come to
the conclusion that they must give over
work for the day, and were again beginning
to feel concern in regard to the continued
absence of the heir himself, when they were
startled by a hail in the voice of the missing
man. They stared out over the lake, and
perceived the canoe darting toward them,
with Margaret plying a skilled paddle from the
bow. Jake, who had just bent to the fly-wheel
of the engine to crank up, dropped
again to the bench; the others stood up and
shouted. They had no least suspicion that
the truants could be bringing news of the
treasure. When finally the light craft ranged
alongside the launch, and the story of the
cavern was told, there were wonder and satisfaction.
Roy was the first to make a suggestion
as to the course to be pursued.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of you go on to the cottage,&#8221; he
directed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stay here on guard, in case our
friend, the engineer, should have a mind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
drop in on a visit. After dinner, let Jake
bring me a snack to eat, and I&#8217;ll keep watch
through the night. You&mdash;&#8221; he turned
toward Margaret and Saxe&mdash;&#8220;can take me
to the island, and show me the entrance to
the cave, and then leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were protestations from the others,
offers to share the watch with him; but Roy
resisted all importunities.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to meet Masters again,&#8221; he
declared, in his gentlest voice. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want
any help.&#8221; They recognized the emphasis
of finality, and forebore further argument.</p>

<p>But, when after dinner at the cottage Jake
was about setting forth in the launch with
supplies for Roy, which in addition to food
included a pair of blankets and a lantern,
David appeared at the boat-house, and
accosted the old man just as the propeller
began to revolve:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your hosses, Jake!&#8221; he called; and
the boatman obediently threw out the clutch,
and steered in a slowing circle to the dock.
As he came alongside, David produced&mdash;with
a deftness of movement that showed
some degree of familiarity with gun-play&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
very businesslike appearing automatic,
which lay snugly in his palm. With his
other hand, he brought forth a box of cartridges.
These and the weapon, he extended
toward Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Roy,&#8221; he explained. Jake nodded, and
stowed the armament in a locker.</p>

<p>The recipient of this equipment displayed
small gratitude for his friend&#8217;s thoughtfulness.
On the contrary, he sniffed when
Jake, after beaching the launch on the strip
of sand where Roy awaited his coming, presented
the automatic and cartridges as first
fruits.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t need a gun,&#8221; Roy declared superciliously;
and his pugnacious jaw was thrust
forward yet once again. And, afterward,
when Jake had accompanied him to the
cavern with the blankets and the lighted
lantern, the boatman&#8217;s well-meant offer to
remain for the night was rejected almost
with indignation. &#8220;You don&#8217;t understand,
Jake,&#8221; Roy said, venomously. &#8220;I personally
have an account to settle with that infernal
engineer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man grinned a cheerful appreciation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he remarked, in a matter-of-fact
tone, &#8220;you got quite some hefty grudge
agin &#8217;im for the way he ducked your sweetheart.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this candid statement, Roy gaped in
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how did you know she&mdash;&#8221; he
began. Then, he halted in confusion. For
the first time in many years, he felt himself
incapable of speech.</p>

<p>Jake chuckled in high good nature, and
deemed that explanation enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, lick &#8217;im good, if ye ketch &#8217;im,&#8221; he
exhorted; and straightway set out on his
return to the cottage, where he and David
were to serve as guards throughout the
night.</p>

<p>Thus left to his own devices, Roy proceeded
to make himself as comfortable as the
circumstances of his situation would permit.
He was sure that the enemy would not
appear on the scene for some time yet, if at
all, and in the interval before that possible
coming he proposed to make himself at ease.
To this end, he placed the lantern in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
center of the chamber on the floor, and
folded the blankets into a comfortable rug,
on which he seated himself cross-legged,
according to the fashion he had learned to
like in the Far East. He was at pains to
have the luncheon-basket conveniently
placed before him, and now began an investigation
of its contents with a curiosity
sharpened by keen appetite. He smiled contentedly
as he brought out a cold sliced fowl,
fresh salad, a vacuum-bottle of hot coffee&mdash;the
dozen other things that would have made
a formidable array, had it not been for the
strength of hunger with which he happily
confronted them. As he renewed energy
with this repast, Roy smiled at the contrast
of its luxuriousness, as compared with many
another that had been his lot in the wild
places. He was alone in the wilderness, as
often of old, but there the similarity ceased,
for in those other places, there had been no
dainties, such as the ones before him, no
napkins of damask, or utensils of silver. And
yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Roy broke off his musings, as he finished
his third cigarette, and set himself to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
arrangements for the night. He removed
his blankets to a point against the wall of
the cavern on the side opposite the entrance,
where a tiny recess offered partial concealment.
In this nook, he spread out the
blankets, extinguished the lantern, stretched
himself in a comfortable posture, and thus
entered on the long vigil. He did not hesitate
to doze, as he was sure that he retained
his old habit of becoming alert at the faintest
sound.</p>

<p>It was hours afterward when he became
broad-awake in an instant. For a time, he
lay motionless, all his senses quickened. The
blackness of the chamber seemed impenetrable,
yet his eyes stared steadfastly into the
dark, expectant for aught that might befall.
It was on hearing, however, that he
depended chiefly to gather information, and
his ears were set keenly. Yet, though he
listened so intently, minute after minute
passed, and there was no least interruption
of the perfect silence.</p>

<p>Roy found himself in a quandary. He
gave Masters credit for a shrewdness equal
to the known unscrupulousness of the fellow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
Undoubtedly, the engineer had lurked on
some vantage spot of the shore throughout
the day, and by this espionage had made
himself acquainted with the progress of
events on the lake. If he had perceived the
landing of Margaret and Saxe on the island,
as probably, almost certainly, he had, he
would have known also of their long tarrying
there, and of Roy&#8217;s remaining on the
island. Perhaps from some elevation
Masters had followed all their activities
through a glass, and had been able by this
method to inform himself precisely concerning
the location of the cavern in which Roy
was lying. Or, even, he might have come
to the island, venturing in by the north-east
side, so that his approach would not have
been observed by the others. He could very
easily have kept himself hidden afterward, as
the unevennesses of the island and the profuse
growth of trees and bushes offered
ample concealment. But, whether the
advent to the island had been earlier or later,
Roy was sure that it was now accomplished,
and that the engineer was there present in
the chamber with him. His sixth sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
spoke the assurance.</p>

<p>After all, it was sight, and not hearing,
that at last served to guide the warden of
the cavern. His eyes, which had been roving
vainly in an effort to pierce the black
space, suddenly caught a faintest glow. It
was so indistinct, so subtly suggested rather
than seen, that for a little Roy believed his
vision deluded by some phosphorescence
within his brain, which had set the nerves
of sight to vibrating. He closed the eyelids
for a moment, then looked again. The
vague hint of radiance far remote still lingered.
On the instant, doubt vanished; in
its stead came certainty.</p>

<p>There could be no question that the light
shone from a distance. Even the faintest
spark anywhere near would have presented
an appearance radically different from this.
The diffusion of it was proof that its origin
was in a light set a long way off. Finally,
Roy guessed that the source of it was shut
out from his direct vision by some obstacle
intervening between him and it, while the
nimbus extended beyond the barrier, and
thus became perceptible. If this were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
indeed, the case, it would be reasonable to
suppose that the person responsible for the
light was equally far away. The conclusion
was by no means inevitable, but it was a
fair assumption. Roy deemed himself justified
in acting upon it.</p>

<p>Forthwith, he got to his feet, using every
caution to avoid the least noise. When erect,
he stood for a time listening, but could detect
no sound. He had removed his shoes before
lying down, and now he went forward in
stockinged feet, very slowly, taking the
direction whence the light seemed to issue,
although its feebleness made the location far
from sure. He used all the skill of which
he was capable in this advance, and did
indeed contrive to avoid making any noise.
When he had gone for two rods, or more,
he halted, and again listened. Nothing, however,
rewarded his attention, and presently
he renewed the tedious progress. Soon, it
was borne in on him that the origin of the
light was within one of the passages leading
downward, of which Saxe had told him, and
of which entrances had been observed by
him while he was eating his meal, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he had not troubled to examine them. His
sense of direction, strong naturally, had been
developed by experience, and he was convinced
that the radiance streamed from the
passage that was on the left, as he faced
the two.</p>

<p>From Saxe&#8217;s narrative, he knew that these
tunnels were winding. The fact would
readily explain the manner of the light,
visible where he was in the big room like
the afterglow from a sunset, with the cause
of it hidden beyond the turnings of the corridor
in which it burned, as the sun lies unseen
below the horizon. With this understanding
of the situation, Roy felt an accession of confidence,
and at once moved forward more
briskly in the direction from which the
illumination shone. He held his hands outstretched,
for the light was still too feeble
to show objects round about him, even
vaguely. Presently, his right hand touched
stone. After another step, his left hand also
came in contact with the wall, and he knew
that he was within the passage, though whether
that on the right or on the left he could only
guess, nor did he regard the matter as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
importance.</p>

<p>From this point onward, Roy&#8217;s advance,
while made with unfailing caution, was
much more expeditious. His stockinged feet
seemed to possess a consciousness of their
own, by which they searched for, and found,
the fragments of rubble that were smooth
enough not to cut, while solid enough not
to yield a sound under the pressure of his
weight. And, as he went forward, the light
increased, little by little, until at last he could
distinguish the sides of the tunnel through
which he was passing. Yet, even when the
illumination became sufficient to show what
sort the footing, Roy chose still to trust his
sense of touch, and held his eyes alert for
anything that might appear in the distance
beyond. He was aware that the passage
descended for a time, then mounted slowly,
only to slope downward again, and to continue
thus. He noted, too, that sometimes
it widened, until he could touch only one
wall. He mistook the opening into the other
passage for one of these broader places.</p>

<p>Roy aroused to the fact that the source of
the light he sought was itself advancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
even as he advanced. There was no other
possible explanation of the way in which
it remained at about the same brilliancy,
though he went forward with good speed.
By this time, too, Roy was certain that the
distance between him and the light was such
as to leave little danger in the slight noise
of his progress. So, he mended his pace, and
soon perceived, with satisfaction, that the
radiance noticeably increased. He maintained
the quickened speed for a minute or
two longer, then prudently moderated it
again. Indeed, so bright was the light now
that he made sure of being very close to the
cause of it, and renewed the exercise of all
his caution as he crept forward. That this
was none too much&mdash;nor, indeed, enough&mdash;was
shown by what presently followed.</p>

<p>Roy paused again, to examine the situation
in detail. The brilliance of the light
now assured him that its source was shut
from him only by a single bend of the tunnel,
which was hardly a rod in front. It was
plain, then, that the time had come for
determining the manner of his attack, since
the moment could not be long delayed. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
had no intention of resorting to the weapon
with which David had equipped him. He
planned that he would approach the turning of
the passage noiselessly, and seek to reconnoitre
from that point without being
observed. Thereafter, as opportunity should
serve, he would steal upon his enemy unaware,
overpower the fellow, handling him
with roughness enough to afford some adequate
satisfaction for the outrage against
May Thurston, and finally, when the villain
had been reduced to passivity, hold him
prisoner&mdash;to which purpose, at last, the automatic
might prove convenient. The arrangement
was admirably simple; there remained
but to test its efficacy.</p>

<p>The length of tunnel thus traversed by
Roy in his pursuit had been considerable.
Throughout the latter portion, the slope had
been downward, with frequent variations
from a sharp incline to stretches almost level.
In the place to which he had now attained,
the slant was scarcely perceptible. At this
distance from the big chamber, he had long
passed beneath the waters of the lake. The
location of the treasure might well be anywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
hereabouts, according to the saying
of the miser&#8217;s cipher. Roy was moved to
devouring curiosity to learn whether or no
the man ahead of him had in truth come
upon the gold. If so, the accomplishment
should avail the scoundrel little, he vowed,
and his jaw was thrust forward, as once again
he advanced.</p>

<p>Roy looked to the placing of his feet for
every step, neglecting no precaution to avoid
aught that might give warning of his
approach. In this stealthy fashion, he came
to the turning of the tunnel, and then, after
another delay to make sure that his presence
remained unsuspected, he ventured to peer
into the passage beyond the bend. His heart
exulted! Surely, fate had delivered his
enemy into his hand.</p>

<p>A hundred feet beyond the corner from
which Roy looked, a lantern was set on the
floor of the passage. This was the source
of the light that he had trailed so painstakingly.
It burned clearly; the radiance from
it showed all about with distinctness. The
conspicuous thing on which the beams shone
was the form of Masters, who was kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
and gazing fixedly down into an opening in
the floor of the cavern. The man was on
the farther side of this, and so had his face
toward the watcher, but absorption in whatever
was displayed beneath him prevented
his noticing the presence of the newcomer.
Roy was, therefore, able to continue his spying
at ease. Curiosity, as well as discretion,
bade him delay attack. He was eager to
learn the nature of the engineer&#8217;s interest in
the opening, and, too, the fellow&#8217;s position,
facing up the tunnel, rendered impossible at
the moment a rush that should take him by
surprise. Undoubtedly, the engineer would
make some movement presently, which
would place him more conveniently for Roy&#8217;s
purpose. In the meantime, it would be
enough to observe, and to await the right
instant for assault.</p>

<p>It may be that Masters, too, possessed a
sixth sense. Roy could never be convinced
that there was not something uncanny in
the events that now immediately followed.
Masters jumped down into the opening,
where he stood with only head and shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
exposed. Then, in an instant, the light of
the lantern vanished&mdash;with that, the crash
of a forty-five, thunderous there within the
cavern. A second report came in the same
instant. A searing pain touched Roy&#8217;s brow,
and he lay unconscious.</p>

<small>THE FIRST PIT</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AT THE cottage that same night, Margaret
made an excuse of fatigue, and
withdrew to her chamber immediately when
dinner was done, to the discomfiture of Saxe.
May Thurston, too, vanished&mdash;perhaps because
Roy was absent, and she preferred
solitude in order that she might think of him
without interruption. Presently Mrs. West
said good night, and the three friends were
left alone in the music-room. It was then
that Saxe proposed to give to Billy Walker
some information he had received from Margaret
during their return trip in the canoe.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found out who was in this room
when you fell through the ceiling,&#8221; Saxe said
to the sage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that!&#8221; Billy retorted contemptuously.
&#8220;It was of no importance. I didn&#8217;t
bother to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean,&#8221; Saxe demanded, in astonishment,
&#8220;that you know already?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; was the crisp answer. &#8220;It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
was Chris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elimination. There was no problem of
interest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a kindergarten form of ratiocination
required,&#8221; the sage went on, with an
air of extreme boredom. &#8220;Cause&mdash;family
devotion. Aged and faithful servitor didn&#8217;t
mean to let you deprive daughter of his mistress
of her share of the money&mdash;meant to
beat you to it, like Masters, but from a
different motive, merely to keep it away from
you until the time limit should expire. Then,
he observed symptoms between you and the
said daughter that convinced him of error in
his plans&mdash;made him realize that keeping
the money away from you would end in
depriving her of half the gold while giving
her a half. Being emotional and devoted, he
confessed to the girl. The girl felt it her
duty to confess to you. It is probable that
Chris was the one to discover the secret
vault in the wall there, whom Roy, without
due reasoning, took to be Masters. Was it
Chris?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Saxe admitted. He was greatly disconcerted
by his failure to add anything to
the seer&#8217;s knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for Chris!&#8221; David exclaimed.
&#8220;Crafty old critter, too, to dig into that safe.
Huh! I&#8217;ve heard about that sort of devotion
on the part of old family servants, but it&#8217;s
the first instance I&#8217;ve struck in my own
experience. Don&#8217;t have &#8217;em in Wyoming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Awful nuisance,&#8221; Billy Walker grumbled,
&#8220;aged family retainers&mdash;doddering remnants,
always butting in!&#8221; He gaped shamelessly,
with a great noise.</p>

<p>Saxe, outraged by the sage&#8217;s flippant reference
to sacred things of his heart, felt himself
indisposed for the further companionship
of his friends just then. It was this mood,
rather than any anxiety concerning the
treasure, that led him to devise an excuse
for separation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get to bed,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and then make
an early start for the island in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker, whose lids were weighted
by the day&#8217;s activities, grinned contentedly
at the first phrase, and scowled portentously
at the second.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea,&#8221; David agreed. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
be off as soon as it gets to be light. I&#8217;ll
tell Jake to call us, and Mrs. Dustin to have
our breakfast ready.&#8221; He bustled out of the
room, eager for the mission.</p>

<p>Billy Walker groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dave is too precipitate,&#8221; he growled; &#8220;too
precipitate by far.&#8221; He rose and started for
his room. &#8220;If we&#8217;re to arise at some ghastly
hour,&#8221; he explained to Saxe, &#8220;I musn&#8217;t lose
an instant in getting to bed. Brain-workers
require ten hours of sleep. It&#8217;s different with
you others.&#8221; His feelings somewhat soothed
by this gibe, he departed.</p>

<p>In consequence of David&#8217;s alertness, they
were routed out of bed the following morning
while yet there was only the most pallid
hint of gray in the east to foretell the dawn.
When Billy Walker found that he required
a lamp to direct the process of his toilet, he
was in a state of revolt. He was thoroughly
disgusted when he discovered artificial light
a necessity at the breakfast-table. He made
it plain to all and sundry that nocturnal
ramblings were not to his mind. But he
sank into wordless grief when the party set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
forth in the launch, for darkness still prevailed,
and he heard Jake announce that
there would be a full hour before the rising
of the sun.</p>

<p>David, for his part, was all eagerness to
be at work. Saxe, too, now that he was in
the open, gave over for a time his dreams of
the one woman, and was filled with zeal
toward this final struggle for the attainment
of fortune. He believed that the day would
determine success or failure in the quest for
Abernethey&#8217;s gold. He had seen to it that
the equipment contained whatever might be
necessary for thorough exploration of the
cavern. In the launch were lanterns, ropes,
pickaxes, shovels, and a miscellany of things,
selected by himself, David and Jake in council.
There was, too, a big hamper of food,
so that they would not need to return to
the cottage for luncheon.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the party at the island,
they made their way at once to the cavern,
carrying only the lanterns. The other things
were left in the launch, to be got as occasion
should require after the preliminary search.
None of them suspected that aught might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
have befallen Roy in the cave. Although
they had come to know something of the
desperate nature of Masters, they were confident
that Roy&#8217;s presence on watch would
have sufficed to keep the engineer at a distance.
So they were all in the best of spirits,
even to Billy Walker who was at last fully
awake, when, after lighting each a lantern,
they pushed aside the bushes that hid the
break in the cliff, and made their way
through the rift into the great chamber. As
they stepped within it, they lifted their
voices in joyous greeting to their comrade.
To their surprise, no answer came to the
hail&mdash;only innumerable echoes flung back
from the recesses.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s off, exploring on his own,&#8221; David
remarked.</p>

<p>Billy Walker, who had been lurching
clumsily here and there with inquisitive eyes,
examining the unfamiliar surroundings by
the light of his lantern, after the fashion of
a modern Diogenes, now turned to Jake with
a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many lanterns did Mr. Morton
have?&#8221; he demanded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>&#8220;Why,&#8221; drawled Jake, astonished at the
interrogation, &#8220;he had jest one, o&#8217; course.
What about it, Mr. Walker?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Simply, the fact is sufficient evidence to
the effect that Roy is not absent on an exploring
expedition by himself, which was David&#8217;s
suggestion. Here is his lantern.&#8221; He
stooped, with a groan in response to the
physical strain involved, picked up the lantern,
which he had observed at his feet where
it stood beside the blankets, and held it out
for the others to see. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite cold,&#8221; he
added. &#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been lighted for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others stared in silence for a little.
Even yet, they were far from suspecting any
evil. It was Jake who spoke at last:</p>

<p>&#8220;I opine, he must have gone outside
some&#8217;rs, to kind o&#8217; stretch &#8217;imself-like. Got
too sleepy, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>But now, David shook his head decisively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Roy&#8217;s ears are mighty
sharp, and we talked loudly enough in the
launch to be heard a mile&mdash;specially Billy. If
Roy had been anywhere on the island, top of
the ground, he&#8217;d have heard us then, and have
come a-running.&#8221; David&#8217;s expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
changed to one of perplexity, in which alarm
mingled. There was a new note of anxiety
in his voice as he concluded: &#8220;And, if he
was anywhere about this place, he&#8217;d have
heard us, too, and have come a-running.
And the lantern here&mdash;&#8221; David&#8217;s big eyes,
shining weirdly through the lenses, went
from one to another of the three men before
him, as if seeking help against the trouble
growing within him.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s some mystery here,&#8221; Saxe
exclaimed. Anxiety sounded in his voice.
&#8220;We must search the cavern at once&mdash;for
him. We already know he&#8217;s not in this
room. We&#8217;ll look through the two passages
that run down under the lake. Come on,
Jake. You and I&#8217;ll take the one on the
right.&#8221; He called over his shoulder to his
friends, as he hurried forward: &#8220;You two
take the passage on the left. If you find him,
try to make us hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was David who found Roy, for impatience
sent him far in advance of plodding
Billy Walker. By the light of the lantern,
David made out the huddled form lying on
the floor of the passage, just at the turning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
He ran forward with a cry of grief, and knelt
beside the body. It had come to him in a
flash that the event was more serious than
anything he had apprehended. Masters had
at last gained a victim. With the lantern set
on the floor close at hand, David raised the
body, which had been lying face downward.
As he did so, he perceived the creased brow,
with its matting of blood, now dried to a
ruddy black. For an instant, David was
stricken with a great fear lest his friend be
dead. But, as he rested the head against
him, a soft moan breathed from the lips, and
at the sound hope sprang alive. He sent
forth a shout, and Billy Walker, who was
near, came running&mdash;for the first time in
many years. No sooner had he learned of
the injury to Roy than he set himself to
summoning the others, and the vast voice
rang thunderous through the subterranean
ways. The mighty volume went rolling in
sonorous waves throughout this secret place
of the earth, penetrating every cranny and
devious winding nook. Saxe and Jake felt
the smiting of it on their ear-drums, and
came racing through the break and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
passage whence the roaring issued. Even
the unconscious man was not impervious to
the gigantic din, he groaned, and his eyelids
unclosed. David raised a hand for silence,
and Billy Walker halted abruptly in his
vociferation, his mouth wide. But, for a
long time, the echoes clanged helter-skelter.</p>

<p>When Saxe and Jake came, they with
David lifted the sufferer, and bore him along
the passage, while Billy went before, bearing
the four lanterns. In this manner, they were
able to make rapid progress, and soon Roy
was placed comfortably on the turf of the
ravine, just outside the cavern entrance, with
a coat to pillow his head. David brought
water in one of the vessels from the hamper
in the launch. Billy Walker, however,
bethought himself of a flask which he had,
and a little sup of the spirits was got into
the wounded man&#8217;s mouth. The effect of
the stimulant was apparent almost at once.
More was administered, with such excellent
results that soon Roy&#8217;s eyes opened, and his
lips moved in a vain attempt to speak. A
moment later, he made a feeble movement,
as if to sit up. Saxe assisted him to a reclining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
posture. When the flask was proffered
a third time, the sufferer was able to swallow
a considerable portion of the liquor. David
now appeared with the water, of which Roy
drank thirstily. He remained quiet while
David bathed his forehead, and, after it had
been thoroughly cleansed, soaked a handkerchief
in the whiskey, and bound it over the
wound. Then finally, Roy spoke intelligibly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The damned skunk got me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Masters!&#8221; Saxe repeated the name
mechanically. There was no need to question&mdash;all
knew.</p>

<p>Roy nodded assent; and his jaw moved
forward, a bit tremulously, but none the less
a proclamation of his mood.</p>

<p>David shook his head, in frank astonishment
over the outcome of the encounter
between the two men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t suppose he was quick enough on
the draw to get you,&#8221; he said, dispiritedly.
&#8220;Huh!&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy resented the implication. His voice
came with new strength, almost snarling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give the devil his due! He&#8217;s quick, all
right. I didn&#8217;t mean to use a gun. I chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
him in the dark down there, and came up to
him. I was watching for a chance to jump
him, when, somehow, he knew that I was
there. I don&#8217;t know what could have given
him a hint. I didn&#8217;t even guess that he had
any suspicion. He fired two shots in a flash.
I didn&#8217;t see him so much as pull the gun.
With the first shot, he put out the lantern,
which was a little way off from him. The
second got me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;in the dark!&#8221; David&#8217;s exclamation
was incredulous.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the dark!&#8221; Roy repeated, weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some class to that shooting,&#8221; David
admitted, with manifest reluctance.</p>

<p>Billy Walker sniffed loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; he exclaimed; and the bourdon
tone went reverberating afar. &#8220;You
should exercise your reasoning powers, my
dear David&mdash;if you have them&mdash;the enemy
had the devil&#8217;s own luck, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the dark!&#8221; David repeated, disputatiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly&mdash;in the dark,&#8221; Billy conceded.
&#8220;Why was the place in darkness? Because
Masters shot out the light. Why did he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
shoot out the light? In order to be invisible
to Roy, and so to avoid being killed himself.
He didn&#8217;t wish to serve as a mark to the
other man. That means, he wasn&#8217;t at all
sure of hitting the other man. He chanced
it, and he had the luck&mdash;better luck than he
expected.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy&#8217;s expression lightened greatly, as
Billy presented this view of the matter. It
took something from the hurt to his pride
sustained in the encounter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to stand up to him,&#8221; he said,
savagely; &#8220;luck, or no luck.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy&#8217;s injury was no worse than a scalp-wound,
and he was soon sufficiently
recovered to be hungry. Afterward, he
solaced himself with a cigarette, and declared
that he would speedily be himself again. He
insisted that, in the meantime, the others
should busy themselves with the work in
hand. He would remain where he was in
the pleasant sunshine, and the luxurious idleness
of it would hasten the restoration of his
strength. Since there was no valid objection
that could be urged to this plan, it was
followed. Pickaxes were secured from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
launch, and then Saxe led the way into the
cavern. It was the common mind that they
should first investigate the passage in which
Roy had suffered defeat at the hands of the
engineer.</p>

<p>The four hurried into the tunnel, and by
the light of their lanterns made good progress
along the rough and winding way. In
about ten minutes, they reached the corner
where Roy had stationed himself in his pursuit
of Masters. They knew that the enemy
had been engaged over something only a
little distance beyond this point, and, as they
advanced, they kept careful watch for the
opening in the floor of the cavern. Presently,
Saxe, who was still in the lead, uttered a
shout.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>As the others came up to him, he pointed
to where, a few feet in front, a break yawned
in the flooring of the tunnel. Immediately,
all were grouped about the edge of the opening,
staring down into it with intense excitement.
By this time, they had come to
respect the resourcefulness of the engineer
and his ability. The fact that the spot had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
held him absorbed appeared to them of high
significance. Since the man had searched
here before their coming, was it not probable
that he had found the gold in this very place?</p>

<p>The opening was perhaps eight feet in
length, by half as many in width. The depth
was irregular. On the south end, it was
hardly more than a foot below the level of
the floor, running thus for a yard; then, it
sloped sharply and unevenly until it was a
full two yards in depth at the wall of the
tunnel, on the side nearer the other passage.
The light of the lanterns shone on a litter of
earth and fragments of stone. There was
no sign of either chest or bags that might
contain treasure. The four stared down in
silence for a long minute.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must dig here,&#8221; David said, eagerly.
&#8220;The money must be buried here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake leaped down into the pit, and
inspected the confused mass of fragments,
while the others looked on curiously. Presently,
he raised his head, and spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I calc&#8217;late we&#8217;re a mite behindhand, as it
were. This hole&#8217;s been dug all over mighty
careful&mdash;and mighty lately, too!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE OTHER PASSAGE</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">DAVID voiced the general consternation:
&#8220;By the Lord, Masters has got the
gold, after all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The following silence admitted the truth
of his lament. Saxe&#8217;s face set grimly. His
tones came harsh, when at last he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep on hunting,&#8221; he said; &#8220;only,
now we&#8217;ll hunt Masters.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake stood disconsolate, scratching his
head, and staring wistfully from one to
another. It was evident that he accepted
the catastrophe as irremediable. Not so
Billy Walker! On the contrary, Saxe had
hardly done speaking when the voice of the
wise man came booming the decrees of ratiocination,
with the usual pedantic note of
authority:</p>

<p>&#8220;The trouble with the disorderly mind is,&#8221;
he began, with didacticism almost insulting,
&#8220;that it jumps to a conclusion without due
consideration of all the facts. Suddenly confronted
with one fact, which is admitted, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
illogical person reaches a judgment without
any scrutiny whatsoever of other vital facts
concerned. Thus, in the instance before us!&#8221;
He paused, and his little dull eyes, twinkling
now from excitement, went from one to another
of the three men before him, who listened
too anxiously to be in the least offended, for
his opening gave them hope. They knew by
experience that Billy&#8217;s reasoning, notwithstanding
all his boasts, was, indeed, usually
exact, proven just by circumstance. The
respectful attention on their faces was grateful
to the seer. As he continued, his manner
was more genial, though no less breathing
the <i>ipse dixit</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake has discovered that someone has
been before us here, digging in this hole.
That is one single, solitary fact. Instantly,
all of you impulsively take it for granted that
Masters has found the gold here, and has
already removed it. As a matter of reason,
the chances are greatly against this unwarrantable
assumption. It is only necessary
to consider all the facts in our possession to
understand this.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, the fact that this hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
has been dug up recently does not prove that
there was gold hidden in it. As far as our
knowledge goes, the treasure may have been
there, or it may not. There is not a particle
of evidence one way or the other. Masters
was after the gold. He hunted here. That&#8217;s
all we know. We do not know whether or not
he found the money here. Even you chaps
must admit that much.&#8221; He regarded the trio
with accusing glances, before which they
nodded a meek assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on, Billy,&#8221; Saxe urged.</p>

<p>The undisguised interest of his audience
served to set the orator in the best of humors,
so that he grinned cheerfully on them as he
resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;There are some facts that tend to show
the impossibility of Masters having already
removed the money from this place. It was
late when Roy got his hurt from the hands
of the engineer. It is reasonable to suppose
that the fellow had had no chance to find,
much less take away, the gold before the time
when he encountered Roy. Now, the time
that elapsed, after Roy received his wound
until our coming to the cavern, was not very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
long. You doubtless remember that we
were routed out at an unchristian hour, little
better than the middle of the night. In fact,
the dawn was still on the other side of the
hills when we made the island. We were
here not more than three hours after Roy
got shot, and it is more likely that the interval
was less. I am inclined to think it was
perhaps not more than two hours. David,
here, knows something about gold and its
weight. I submit as reasonable the statement
that, had Masters found the gold in
this hole, he could not in the time at his disposal
have removed that weight of metal to
any distance without aid.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are justified in believing that he works
unaided, for the sake of greed and for the
sake of prudence. If you bear in mind the
length of this passage, and the impossibility
of traversing it except slowly and cautiously,
even unburdened, you will appreciate my
reasons for suspecting that Masters has not
carried off the gold.&#8221; Billy stared inquiringly
at the listeners, and appeared elated as they
severally nodded agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; David declared, &#8220;I believe it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
have been next to impossible for him to have
got away with it, even if he hid it close by
on the island. From the way the blood on
Roy&#8217;s face was caked, and the color of it, I
don&#8217;t believe it had been an hour after the
shooting when we got here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re right about that,&#8221; Billy averred,
&#8220;it makes the probability of my reasoning
a certainty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure,&#8221; David answered. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
seen bullet-holes enough to be pretty sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, then,&#8221; Saxe exclaimed, briskly, and
there was new confidence in his voice, &#8220;it seems
to me that we&#8217;re just where we were&mdash;with the
gold still to find. In the first place, we must
make sure that it isn&#8217;t still here in this pit, and,
if it isn&#8217;t, we must go ahead with the search of
the cavern, until we find out where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy emitted a rumbling chuckle, as Saxe
leaped down into the pit, and raised a pickaxe.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear boy,&#8221; the sage cried, in bantering
compliment, &#8220;for once you have reasoned
simply and precisely. Bravo!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not much time was required to make evident
the fact that there could be nothing of value
concealed in the pit. The litter was readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
penetrated, and revealed beneath it solid rock,
undisturbed since first set there by the processes
of primeval ages. The discovery was
a source of relief, rather than of disappointment,
and Saxe, doubtless encouraged by the
tribute accorded to his reasoning powers by
Billy Walker, called attention to the fact that
the amount of loose matter in the pit was far
from being sufficient to have concealed any
great bulk of gold. It was, therefore, reasonable
to suppose that the treasure had never
been buried in this place.</p>

<p>The seer gave a grunt of approbation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You advance by leaps and bounds,&#8221; he
declared.</p>

<p>Exploration of the continuance of the passage
was speedily effected, as it narrowed
immediately beyond the pit, and came to a
definite end within ten yards. Thereupon, the
four retraced their steps, inspecting with care
every inch of the way, until they reached the
break that formed a communication between
the two tunnels. It was decided now that the
party should divide, Billy and David keeping
on in this passage, while Saxe and the boatman
crossed into the other, there to follow its length<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
under the lake.</p>

<p>Saxe knew that he and the girl had gone a
little way beyond the junction of the passages,
and he was intensely eager to learn what might
lie farther on. Hope mounted high as he set
forth down the slope, with Jake hard at his
heels. He realized that, for ill or weal, he was
close to the issue of his adventure, and he
dared expect success.</p>

<p>The way at first led downward steeply, but
afterward, at a point which, as Saxe judged,
was still well within the island, the tunnel
ascended for a time, then ran level. This level
broadened presently into a chamber, larger
even than that back at the entrance to the
cavern. Their lanterns showed a room fully a
hundred feet in diameter, irregular, its walls
broken by many ledges, with here and there
deep shadows that might shroud the entrances
to other passages.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not the place, though,&#8221; Saxe declared;
&#8220;for we are too high. This isn&#8217;t under the
lake&mdash;and the cipher says, &#8216;The Bed of the
Lake.&#8217; Come on, Jake.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led the way toward a tunnel that yawned
blackly on the south side of the chamber. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
sloped sharply downward, without a bend.
Saxe, who possessed an instinct for location
that was rarely at fault, had kept careful watch
of every change in direction throughout the
exploration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake,&#8221; he said abruptly, after the straight
course had been followed for a few rods, &#8220;if
we keep on like this, we ought to hit the passage
where the pit is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess not,&#8221; the boatman objected. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
been all over that-thar tunnel, and there ain&#8217;t
no place where this-here tunnel comes into it.
Now, what do ye say to that, Mr. Temple, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a blessed thing,&#8221; Saxe replied. &#8220;You&#8217;re
right, of course, and yet&mdash;anyhow, I&#8217;d be willing
to wager we&#8217;ll run within a rod of the other
passage, at farthest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t no way of settlin&#8217; that-thar idee o&#8217;
your&#8217;n,&#8221; Jake commented, with a cackle.
&#8220;Guess as how I don&#8217;t pine to bet none.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two went on in silence after this, moving
at a fair rate of speed, for the tunnel was
only slightly encumbered with dbris, but they
did not permit haste to breed neglect of their
purpose. Ever, as they went, they kept a careful
lookout for aught that might by any possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
be a hiding-place for the miser&#8217;s gold.
On either side, they looked, above, below&mdash;always
in vain. Nowhere in the descent was
there anything to suggest a receptacle for
stores of precious metal. Suddenly, Saxe,
who from his place in advance had been peering
before him anxiously, spoke in a voice of
discouragement:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake, I believe we&#8217;re coming to the end
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boatman quickened his steps, and
reached the speaker&#8217;s side. The two halted.
By the light of their lanterns, they saw a wall
of stone, which barred further passage. Here
was, indeed, the end of the tunnel. Jake
nodded his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;it&#8217;s the end, sure enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The floor is broken!&#8221; Saxe cried, of a sudden.
In an instant, he was surcharged with
excitement. Jake, too, was thrilled. Together,
they stared fixedly at the space that stretched
level from their feet to the end of the tunnel.
Wildest hope was welling in Saxe&#8217;s breast now.
In the interstices of broken rock before him,
imagination caught the yellow gleam of coins.</p>

<p>For, at this point, the floor of the cavern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
showed some evidence of containing a natural
opening similar to that in the other passage, at
the place where Roy had seen Masters. But,
where the other opening had been plainly
visible, and, in fact, only partially filled by the
pieces of stone within it, this was full to the
top with rock fragments, neatly compacted&mdash;so
neatly compacted, in truth, that it were easy
to suspect the cunning of man in their precise
adjustment, rather than the haphazard of
nature. Gazing down on that orderly arrangement,
the two men became certain that here, at
last, was the spot chosen by the dead miser for
the concealment of his store. Yet, for a little,
each hesitated to begin the examination that
would prove conclusive. They were half-fearful
of putting conviction to the test of proof.
Perhaps, too, the delight of anticipation held
them in thrall. Saxe walked slowly along
one side of the broken place, until he came to
the end of the tunnel. There, something in the
rocky wall caught his attention, and he
regarded the terminal formation more critically.
Presently, he turned to Jake, and spoke
with an air of triumph:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I was right about this passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
running to the one where we found Roy. This
is a continuation of the other. The opening
in the floor here is the other half of the one
into which Masters burrowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe so, maybe so,&#8221; Jake replied,
in a voice that was plainly skeptical. &#8220;But jest
how do ye make out all that-thar information?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By my bump of location, chiefly,&#8221; Saxe
admitted. &#8220;But there&#8217;s corroborative evidence
in the fact that the wall here is only a big
boulder, along with a lot of smaller stones
which block the passage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, so be,&#8221; the boatman commented
placidly, &#8220;I don&#8217;t calc&#8217;late as how it makes a
mighty sight o&#8217; difference, one way or t&#8217;other.
The p&#8217;int is, what in tarnation&#8217;s under here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Saxe conceded. &#8220;Merely, it
pleases my vanity to have been right.&#8221; He
came to the old man&#8217;s side, and spoke with a
quick sharpness in his tone: &#8220;And now, Jake,
let&#8217;s find out if there&#8217;s anything here.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few blows from the pickaxes loosened the
closely packed pieces of stone. The two then
began to cast out these to one side. They
found the work simple enough, though fatiguing,
for many of the rocks were of formidable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
weight; but all were lying loosely, once the
top layer had been removed.</p>

<p>Saxe paused for a brief rest, after having
with difficulty heaved a huge stone from the
pit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Abernethey never could have handled
these,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;The idea is absurd.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boatman shook his head in emphatic
denial.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you go worrying yourself none over
that,&#8221; he counseled. &#8220;That-thar old man was
a wonder in some ways. He was mighty
powerful in his arms and chist. I seen him
oncet lift a barrel o&#8217; vinegar up by the chines
into a wagon. I reckon he acquired consid&#8217;ble
muscle from the pianner; he used to wallop
it some tremendous, I tell you! Yep, he
could h&#8217;ist out a heftier rock nor you or me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This information quickened Saxe&#8217;s hope,
and he toiled on with increased energy. The
boatman showed an equal zeal. The pit grew
deeper momently. Suddenly, Jake gave forth
a great shout:</p>

<p>&#8220;Jumpin&#8217; Jehosaphat! We&#8217;ve struck it!&#8221;
He straightened up, his face creased with
innumerable wrinkles of happiness as he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
across the pit at Saxe.</p>

<p>The heir of Abernethey was beside the
speaker within the second. As he bent forward,
following the boatman&#8217;s gesture, he saw,
in the open place left by the removal of the
stone, a surface of oak. He understood that
this must be the cover of a chest. An exclamation
of triumph broke from his lips. He
made no effort to conceal his agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Quick!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get the
other stones off.&#8221; He hurled from the pit with
ease one which, a minute before, he could
hardly have stirred. The splendid madness of
success tripled strength. The old man beside
him shared in the frenzy of toil. Within an
incredibly short time, the oak covering was
laid bare, and one corner of the chest stood
exposed for its whole height. It was a great
box of polished wood, brass-bound at the corners.
The cover was made fast by hasp and
padlock&mdash;the whole simple, yet very strong
and handsome.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; Jake cried, as he paused from
the work to wipe his dripping forehead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; Saxe answered, as he, too,
rested. Then, he remained staring at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
mighty box, wherein lay a fortune. He was
too dazed by the final victory to think with
coherence: he could but feel, with every atom
of the energy in him.</p>

<p>There was no further interchange between
the two for some time. In silence, they again
attacked the litter of rock that surrounded the
chest. It was freed at last from the rampart
that had shielded it. Jake put his shoulder
against the side, and essayed an experimental
push. With a groan from the strain, he
abandoned the futile effort. There was vast
contentment in his smile when he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;I calc&#8217;late that-thar box will heft pretty
consid&#8217;ble. It&#8217;s gold, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s the gold,&#8221; Saxe agreed, dreamily.
He was thinking of Margaret now, and he
smiled as he reflected on the fact that the
miser&#8217;s legacy would fall to her and him
together. A great longing to be alone assailed
him. He turned impulsively to the boatman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry, and find the others, Jake!&#8221; he
directed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet ye!&#8221; the boatman responded, with
alacrity. He was eager to bear the tidings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
In a trice, he had scrambled out of the pit,
seized his lantern, and set off briskly up the
slope of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Left alone, Saxe lighted a cigarette, smiling
a little as he noted the manner in which his
hands were trembling. Then, he seated himself
comfortably at the edge of the pit, and
gazed raptly down on the treasure-chest.</p>

<small>THE BLAST</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">ROY, after an hour of basking on the turf
in the mellow warmth of the sunshine,
felt himself his own man again, in spite of the
dull pain in his head. Curiosity spurred him
to action. He stretched himself luxuriously,
then stood up, bent his right arm until the
biceps was iron hard, to prove that the strength
was still in him. Thereafter, he made his way
into the cavern. When he had come into the
big room, he found his lantern by the aid of
matches, lighted it, and then paused, listening,
uncertain as to which of the two passages he
should follow. He could hear nothing, and
presently decided on the left one, in which he
had met his discomfiture. He traversed this
until he reached the rift that gave communication
with the adjacent tunnel. Here, again,
he halted, to give ear intently, and once again
he could detect no sound. He decided that his
friends must be somewhere in the passage on
the right, and crossed into it, continuing the
descent. He had not gone far when he heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the familiar roaring of Billy Walker&#8217;s voice,
and knew that those whom he sought were
ahead of him in the tunnel. He quickened his
steps, and, much to his astonishment, found
that the way now led upward, rather steeply.
He reached a level, and heard the huge voice
of the sage, followed by the mellow peal of
David&#8217;s laughter. An instant later, he stood
within the second chamber of the cavern, and
called out to his friends, who were moving
slowly along the side opposite him.</p>

<p>Just as the two turned in surprise on recognizing
the wounded man&#8217;s voice thus unexpectedly,
another noise caught their ears, and
caused them to check the greetings on their
lips. From the third passage came the clatter
of feet running swiftly over the stone floor.
As they gazed, the squat figure of Jake darted
into the room, to halt, panting, as his eyes fell
on the three men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; the boatman gasped weakly, for
the hasty pace from the pit below had winded
him. He swung his lantern in a flourish of
triumph.</p>

<p>The glee of the man permitted only one possible
explanation. The three witnesses of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
exultant entrance knew that the treasure had
been found. Forthwith, they shared the messenger&#8217;s
excitement. Jake told his story in few
words. Within a half-minute of his coming,
the four were hurrying down the third passage,
toward the spot where Saxe was waiting
beside his chest of gold. He heard the noise
of their approach, and, with a little start,
aroused himself from the blissful dreaming
into which he had fallen, wherein the gold of
a woman&#8217;s hair had counted as of more worth
than that locked in the brass-bound box at his
feet.</p>

<p>There ensued a period of general joy, though
the specific causes of delight varied somewhat.
Jake took keen pleasure in the fact that the
one exciting incident of a humdrum life was
ending in success. David was glad that the
adventure on which he had embarked was
achieved with victory to his friend&#8217;s hopes.
Roy was savagely pleased over this discovery,
which thus summarily put an end to Masters&#8217;
ambitions. Billy beheld with pride a final vindication
of his exactitude in ratiocination.
Saxe was happy in the thought that here was
wealth to offer the one whom he loved. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
subtly sweet flavor of that happiness was in
the knowledge that the way to it had been
pointed by her whom his friends had called his
logical enemy. His enemy&mdash;she, Margaret!
His lips curved to a tender smile.</p>

<p>Roy promptly assumed control of the operations
involved in the disposal of the treasure.
He had been a practical miner, was skilled in
ingenious devices for the moving of heavy
weights. He appointed David, who had had
similar experiences, his chief helper. Billy
Walker seated himself as comfortably as he
might on one of the fragments cast up from
the pit, and prepared to offer such comments
on future events as should suggest themselves
to an orderly and logical mind. Jake proposed
breaking open the lock, and then loading themselves
with as much gold as they could carry,
for transportation to the launch. Roy refused
acceptance of this simple method.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must weight about a thousand pounds,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s too heavy for us to carry all the
way to the shore alone. Bring that heaviest
cable from the launch, Jake, and the pulley-tackle
that&#8217;s in the locker. Do that first.
Perhaps Dave and I may be able to rig the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
pulley, and haul the chest up into the room
above. Then, after you&#8217;ve brought the rope,
go in the launch, and get half-a-dozen men
from the Landing, to help. Bring along, too,
four heavy poles. We&#8217;ll lash those on, to serve
as handles in carrying the chest to the launch.
Arrange for a lumber wagon at the Landing.
Miss Thurston told me there&#8217;s a bank at the
nearest town&mdash;Hadley&mdash;about three miles
from the Landing. Eh?&#8221; Jake nodded assent.
&#8220;The day&#8217;s young yet,&#8221; Roy concluded.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll land Abernethey&#8217;s gold in the bank
before night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bank shets up at three o&#8217;clock,&#8221; the boatman
objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll open again fast enough for what&#8217;s in
this box,&#8221; Roy retorted. &#8220;You hurry up that
cable, Jake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with him,&#8221; David said. &#8220;It may
need more than the cable length for the business,
it&#8217;s quite a stretch up that slope.&#8221; Roy
nodded assent, and the two hastened off.</p>

<p>During their absence, Roy, with the assistance
of Saxe, busied himself in arranging a
smooth plane of stones in that end of the pit
nearer the ascent, in such fashion as to afford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
an easy slide for the chest. Soon, the cable
was brought, and, while the others devoted
themselves to the adjustment of this, Jake
departed on his mission to the Landing.</p>

<p>The workers in the tunnel found themselves
confronted with serious difficulty when it came
to passing the rope underneath the chest. It
required the joint efforts of the four, though
Billy Walker&#8217;s aid was not contributed without
expostulation against the uselessness of
this part of the labor. In the end, however,
what by great exertion on the part of each and
by the employment of the pickaxes as levers
and bits of rock as supports, the task was
achieved, and the rope was got in position
under the chest. The remainder of the business
was simple enough. In a short time, the
box was firmly set within the hempen bands,
knotted with seamanlike smartness by Roy,
and the main length of the cable was free for
adjustment to block and tackle. The extent
of it, to Roy&#8217;s relief, proved ample for the purpose,
and forthwith he and David carried the
free end of it up the slope to the level of the
chamber, in quest of some projection of rock
to which the hook of the block might be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
fast. Saxe and Billy remained below, beside
the treasure-chest.</p>

<p>Saxe lighted another cigarette, Billy had
recourse to one of his customary black cigars,
and the two smoked contentedly in silence.
Saxe could hear indistinctly from time to time
the movements of Roy and David, busy on the
level above. And then, presently, his ears
detected another sound. He listened&mdash;idly at
first, soon with growing interest, finally with
intent curiosity, which swiftly became excitement.
The noise was faint, intermittent, yet
persistent. In his earlier attention to it, Saxe
found difficulty in locating the direction whence
the sound issued, but, later on, he became sure
that it had its origin somewhere in the other
passage, beyond the barrier that divided the
pit into two parts. The fact filled him with
amazement. He knew the whereabouts of all
in his own party. He could still hear Roy and
David, active on the level above; Billy Walker
was there present with him by the pit; Jake,
ere this, was on his way to the Landing in the
launch. It was impossible that the boatman
should have disobeyed instructions, to return
into the other passage for some mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
purpose of his own. But, since all the members
of his party were thus accounted for, the
explanation of that persistent sound there
beyond the barrier became more difficult. It
was certain that someone was occupied at the
end of the other passage. Who, then, could
that person be? It could not be Margaret, the
only other who knew the entrance to the cavern.
No, not the only other who knew&mdash;there
was Masters! On the instant, as the thought
came, Saxe knew that the enemy was again at
work.</p>

<p>The reason baffled the listener. What could
the man of treacherous schemes be doing thus
on the wrong side of the barrier? Saxe felt
the puzzle too hard for his solving, and turned
to Billy Walker, seeking the light of pure reason
to clear away the mists of darkness with
which the event was shrouded. The sage was
nodding in somnolent relaxation, though still
puffing his cigar.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Billy!&#8221; Saxe called, softly.</p>

<p>The dozing man straightened, and the small
eyes opened on the disturber in an indignant
stare.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asleep,&#8221; he remarked crossly, following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
the universal habit of denial in such
case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, listen,&#8221; Saxe requested. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you hear that noise&mdash;like somebody pounding?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sage gave ear obediently. It was evident
that, after a moment of attention, he perceived
the noise, for his expression brightened
to one of interest. His inference as to the
significance of the occurrence was not left long
in doubt. He turned presently to Saxe, with
a wide grin on his heavy lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our nimble and indefatigable friend is at
his old tricks again,&#8221; he declared, in a whisper,
without the least hesitation. &#8220;There remains
for our deduction the precise variety of this
latest deviltry.&#8221; Having thus delivered himself,
the oracle closed his eyes, and, while continuing
to listen, scowled portentously in token
of absorbed ratiocination, which Saxe was at
pains not to interrupt. It was perhaps two
minutes before Billy Walker spoke again.
When he did so, there was unaccustomed liveliness
in the method of his delivery; he displayed
an agitation that first startled Saxe,
then alarmed him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>&#8220;You said that Miss West mentioned another
entrance to this cavern; Masters has
probably availed himself of that. He has spied
on us, and so has learned of our discovery of
the treasure here. He has not dared to attack
the lot of us openly. Very likely, he believes
it will take us a considerable time to get out
the chest. He may have come near enough to
hear Roy and Dave up there, and from the
silence between you and me he has supposed
no one left here. He intends to get a hole
through the barrier there, then to have the
chest open, and to help himself to what he can
while nobody&#8217;s looking. He may expect to
have the whole night to work in. Of course,
there&#8217;s a possibility he may mean just to get a
loophole, and then pick us off one by one.
That&#8217;s not likely, but he&#8217;s capable of anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have something of a job to break
through there,&#8221; Saxe objected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dynamite is a quick worker,&#8221; the sage
vouchsafed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dynamite!&#8221; Saxe repeated, aghast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dynamite,&#8221; Billy stated again, with
emphasis. &#8220;We know that he understands how
to employ the explosive on occasion.&#8221; He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
stood up, seized his lantern, and started at a
half-trot up the ascent. &#8220;Probably, he wouldn&#8217;t
mind much if some of us got hurt.&#8221; He
turned his head to shout raucously over his
shoulder at Saxe, who below him stood staring
in horrified amazement: &#8220;But he&#8217;ll be at a
safe distance, and&mdash;so&#8217;ll I.&#8221; He ran on, wheezing
grievously. Yet once again, he turned to
roar toward his friend, in a voice of menace:
&#8220;Run, you blithering idiot&mdash;for your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>At that, the paralysis of astonishment fell
from Saxe. He, in turn, caught up his lantern,
and set off racing up the slope. He had
gone scarcely a dozen steps when a report
sounded behind him. It was not loud&mdash;indeed,
it was so faint and muffled that, for a moment,
Saxe doubted if, in truth, this could be the explosion
prophesied by Billy Walker. He halted
and looked back. From his position, he could
see with sufficient clearness to the barrier. In
the dim light, he could distinguish no apparent
change in the aspect. Then, of a sudden, his
eyes fell on a rush of waters near the floor at
the end of the passage. Now that the echoes
of the detonation had passed, he heard the
hissing of their flow. Even as he stared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
astounded, vaguely terrified, though without
understanding of the catastrophe, the flood
mounted visibly. In a flash of horror, Saxe
realized the peril darting upon him. He
whirled with a great cry and fled from the
death that menaced. A swift glance over his
shoulder as he reached the level, showed the
boiling element hard on his heels. He shouted
a second time, in futile warning to his friends.
In the next moment, the light of his lantern
revealed Billy Walker, running at a good pace
just before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Masters has let in the lake!&#8221; Saxe cried
frantically in his friend&#8217;s ear, as he came
abreast.</p>

<p>There was no need of the telling. Even as
he spoke, the first waves lashed their feet. No
time was given them to mend their speed.
Before they could do more than realize the
coming of the flood, it had reached to their
waists, to their armpits. They had dropped
the drenched lanterns&mdash;they were swimming
blindly on the rushing torrent. But Billy,
whose bulk kept him afloat easily, had put out
a hand, so that he held fast to Saxe&#8217;s collar.
Thus, they were borne onward together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
through the fearful blackness, tossed and torn
by the coil of waters. That contact of each
with the other was their single comfort.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, they felt themselves twisted
violently to one side. Then, for once, the
majestic volume of Billy Walker&#8217;s voice served
his necessity. The words bellowed in Saxe&#8217;s
ear came softly, as from an infinite distance,
yet clearly.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no turn like that&mdash;we&#8217;re in the
chamber. Make to the left&mdash;to the ledges, for
your life! It&#8217;s our only chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>By mercy of fate, the eddy helped them on
their course. But for that, they could never
have won through against the mighty urge of
the current. The eddy sent them far to the
left, and they fought on with all their strength,
when the pull of it would have swung them
back toward the vortex. Then as he felt that
he could strive no more, Saxe felt his fingers
touch on stone. While his hand rasped on the
rock for hold, his feet found footing. In the
next moment, he realized as never before the
great strength of his companion. A violent
thrust upward fairly shot him clear of the
water. Before he had time to help himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
Billy was again at his side, was dragging him
still higher on the tumble of rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the top!&#8221; boomed the sage. &#8220;It may be
high enough, and it may not. Anyhow, it&#8217;s
the only chance.&#8221; And, presently, the two were
on the summit of the pile of stone. Below
them, the writhing waters clamored in rage.
But the flood did not reach to them. Each
second, Saxe expected to feel the swirl of it
about his feet, leaping to engulf him; he was
shuddering from dread of it. The quick horror
of the event bred cowardice. Then, yet once
again, he heard the huge voice of his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re safe&mdash;safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Saxe could not believe him.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; he shouted.</p>

<p>The sage had not heard the feebler tones
through the din, but he guessed the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water just reaches my foot. It has
mounted no higher through a full minute.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it may yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time, Billy heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Use your reason, the water at my foot
marks the level of the lake. It can rise no
higher. Cheer up, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<small>ENTOMBED</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR a little, after he had realized the fact
that the water could mount no higher,
Saxe experienced such joy as must come to
any normal person on escaping out of the peril
of death. Ultimately, however, the first emotion
wore itself out by its own intensity, and
he was left free to think coherently again. The
result was disastrous. There leaped in his consciousness
the hideous truth that death was not
avoided, only postponed. This refuge on the
heap of rocks offered safety from drowning,
from being crushed by the waves against the
walls. It gave no more. On this tiny island,
the two were marooned, with naught to expect
save a slow, a frightful death. They had been
borne hither on the first in-rush of the waters,
and only the height of the cavern had saved
them at that time. Now, there was no means
by which they might make their way out from
this prison. Beyond the chamber in which
they were, the passage that led to the outdoors
first dipped sharply. For a great way it must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
be filled with the flood. Margaret West had
spoken of another entrance somewhere, but she
had told him nothing in detail. It was evident
that this could not be in the chamber, or if
there, it must be covered by the lake&#8217;s flow,
incapable of affording egress. Had it place
near the roof, the light of it must have shown
clearly against the Stygian blackness. And
there was no faintest gleam of light anywhere.
Saxe&#8217;s eyes roved in fierce longing, but
nowhere was there aught except the total darkness.
For once, the sage had reasoned ill.
There had been grisly mockery in his cry that
they were safe&mdash;in this place where there could
be no safety. This was in truth the safety of
the tomb&mdash;a narrow perch whereon to attend
death, to wait, supine, impotent, for a laggard
dissolution by starvation. And Billy realized
now the dread certainty of their plight; otherwise,
he had not sat there in grim silence.
Surely, Roy and David had the better part,
since their engulfment had been swift. They
were spared the lingering tortures of these survivors,
destined to a few dreadful hours. Then
Saxe remembered the miser&#8217;s gold, and the
hate of it welled high in his heart. Truly, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
had been a curse on it! And the wretched man
thought of Margaret most of all. But that
which he thought of her should not be written.
It was the supreme agony.</p>

<p>Saxe had the courage of the strong man, but
nature permits no man to lay down his life
uselessly without revolt. Neither Saxe nor
Billy was a coward, yet each was craven there
in that eyrie above the flood, which imprisoned
them in eternal night. The crime of Masters
had brought wanton destruction upon them.
There was no solace of justice in this doom.
They were abandoned of hope. Their hearts
were sick within them.</p>

<p>Billy Walker spoke at last, and his voice was
humbler than its wont, less sonorous, too. The
first angry uproar of the waters was ended
now, although they were rippling and swirling
daintily still, as if in tender caresses of the
rocks, which so recently they had smitten in
fury. Above the gentle noise of the eddies,
the sage&#8217;s voice, mild as it was comparatively,
sounded clearly. Instantly, a cry came from
the far side of the chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! Billy! You&#8217;re alive!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Roy&#8217;s voice, and another voice broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
in on the words, shouting shrilly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy! Thank God!&#8221; It was David&#8217;s voice.</p>

<p>Billy roared so joyously that all other tones
were lost for a time, but, at last, Roy and
David caught Saxe&#8217;s higher pitch, and they
were glad anew. Across the room, questions
and answers were volleyed. It was made
known that Roy and David, at the first rush of
the lake upon them, had held to the projections
of the rock where they had just made fast the
tackle, and had climbed higher until they were
safe above the flood. Now, they rested aloft
on a tiny shelf of stone, only a little way
beneath the roof, and they, even as Saxe and
Billy, realized to the full the impossibility of
escape from this sepulchre within the earth.
And Roy lamented in characteristic fashion,
after Saxe and Billy had explained the cause
of the lake&#8217;s in-flow, which had been a mystery
to the other two.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t have had a chance at
Masters before he went.&#8221;</p>

<p>David&#8217;s voice, usually so kindly, was harsh
as he spoke:</p>

<p>&#8220;The skunk got us, after all,&#8221; he mourned.
He added, with frank ferocity: &#8220;Damn him!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
He knew, as did the others, that such speech
concerning the dead was unseemly. Yet none
rebuked him. For a moment, the warmth of
wrath was comfort against the chill desolation
of their case.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Billy Walker&#8217;s ruling passion
was so strong that not even death might daunt
it. The action of Masters required some
explanation, to make all clear before the less-orderly
minds of his friends. So, after a period
of reflection, he expounded his understanding
of the engineer&#8217;s part in the final act of their
drama. The volume of his voice was such that
he did not need to go beyond his usual conversational
thundering to be heard distinctly by
those on the opposite side of the chamber.</p>

<p>&#8220;Masters, naturally, didn&#8217;t mean to do this
thing,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t the type to
commit suicide. He kept track of us all the
time. How he did it doesn&#8217;t matter especially.
Probably, he used another entrance to the
cavern, which we don&#8217;t know. Anyhow, he
learned what it was we had found down this
way. I guess he spied on us, and heard you,
Roy, and Dave, working on the tackle, and
took it for granted we were all here together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
He thought he could burrow through, and get
at the gold himself while we were off after
help. He meant to blow an opening just big
enough to get through, I fancy. He failed to
take into consideration the frailness of the roof
that stood between the passage and the lake.
He blew a hole in the bottom of the lake&mdash;and
that was the beginning of our troubles, and the
ending of his. He couldn&#8217;t find a refuge like
ours in that other passage. <i>Exit</i> Masters&mdash;I
regret our fate, but not his.&#8221; With this succinct
statement, the sage relapsed into silence,
which continued until Roy relieved his overwrought
feelings by a denunciation against
fate.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been on the edge of dying many a
time,&#8221; he declared, bitterly; &#8220;but I was never
up against this sort of thing before, and I&#8217;m
free to say that I don&#8217;t like it. There&#8217;s some
satisfaction in being done to death in a good
fight, or in battling your best against any kind
of odds. Of course, a man doesn&#8217;t exactly
want to die, any time. But what puts me in
the dumps is this particular variety of dying
that we&#8217;re up against here. We&#8217;ve got to sit
roosting on a shelf in the dark, like a heathen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
idol in a temple after it&#8217;s been buried in an
earthquake&mdash;and we&#8217;ve just got to sit till we
starve to death. I do hope I run across Masters
in the next world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us hope for your own sake that both
you and Dave do not have your wishes granted
concerning Masters in the next world,&#8221; Billy
exclaimed. The grim jest was not amusing in
their situation. The three hearers shivered a
little, and were silent.</p>

<p>Afterward, the four gave themselves to serious
meditation, as is fitting to men in the
presence of death. On one occasion, Billy, in
answer to a question from David, discoursed
freely on the reasonableness of belief in a
future life, and pleaded in defense of such
faith with a lucid sincerity and completeness
that first surprised, then comforted his audience.
Each, after his own fashion, believed in
the continuance of life through death; none the
less, each was loath to put off the garment of
mortality. Billy Walker would fain have remained
on earth for a larger accumulation of
its wisdom, with which, as it seemed to him, he
had only just begun. Saxe&#8217;s heart was near to
breaking over the knowledge that he must go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
from Margaret into the unknown places, where
she would not be. Roy felt the like desolation
because of May. David, since he had no particular
thing to regret with superlative sadness,
let his longing touch on many things, and grief
was heavy upon him, because he must lose
all&mdash;all!</p>

<p>A single incident afforded the unhappy men
diversion from their plight. After some discussion,
it was agreed that it would make the
situation a trifle less dreary if the four of them
were gathered in one place, instead of being
divided by the width of the chamber. The
shelf on which Roy and David had ensconced
themselves was not of a size sufficient to accommodate
the other two. For that matter,
its dimensions were unduly restricted even for
those already there. On the other hand, the
top of the heap of rocks up which Saxe and
Billy had climbed afforded ample room for all,
besides giving better opportunity for the securing
of water to drink, since the massed stones
were easy of ascent and descent. Unfortunately,
there was a difficulty in the way of
consummating the assembly of the four in the
one place, due to the fact that David could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
swim. It was arranged finally, however, that
Billy Walker should swim across the chamber,
being guided by the voices of Roy and David,
and that then he and Roy should support the
other across to the heap of stones, being guided
in turn by the voice of Saxe, who would remain
behind for that purpose. At once, when this
arrangement had been made, Billy clambered
down the rocks with many a sigh, until the
water supported him. Then, he swam easily to
the point from which Roy was calling. David
let himself down into the water through the
blackness without demur as his friends bade
him, and very quickly he was carried across to
the place indicated by the voice of Saxe. A
minute later, the four friends were reunited on
their microscopic island, and the fact yielded
them a pleasure melancholy and fleeting, yet a
pleasure, an alleviation, where no alleviation
had seemed possible.</p>

<p>Even in this fatal plight, the sage preserved
his serenity, and from time to time startled his
companions by his utterances, thus breaking in
by ever so little on the torment of their spirits.
They had just finished drinking as best they
might from cupped hands dipped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
water at their feet, and David had spoken of
being already hungry, when Billy laughed in
his usual noisy outburst.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Always, when a
man is confronted with absolute lack of provisions,
he at once develops a ravenous appetite.
He may have eaten five meals on the day of
the wreck, and have gorged to repletion five
minutes before the ship foundered. When he
has become acquainted with the fact that he
is adrift on the ocean in an open boat with only
a few drops of water in the beaker, and ten
wormy biscuits for six persons, he immediately
begins to feel the gnawing pangs of ravenous
hunger and deadly thirst. Naturally it will
be so with us. David has already spoken.
For my part, I confess that I, too, hear the
generalissimo of the belly clamoring for reinforcements,
although I enjoyed a capital and
capacious breakfast, and it&#8217;s not yet anywhere
near the scheduled hour for luncheon on the
earth above.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that, there came a chorus of protests
from the others, who had listened patiently
enough hitherto:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>&#8220;Not time for luncheon!&#8221; Roy exclaimed,
indignantly. &#8220;Man, you&#8217;re crazy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s well along in the night,&#8221; Saxe affirmed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or, maybe, toward the morning of next
day.&#8221; David spoke with the emphasis of entire
conviction. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been here close to twenty-four
hours, already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or even more,&#8221; Roy added, defiantly.</p>

<p>Billy Walker chuckled&mdash;a great volume of
sound, which sent multiplying echoes afar over
the placid water that shut them off from life.</p>

<p>&#8220;The exercise of reason convinces me that
all of you are quite wrong,&#8221; the sage remarked,
very genially. &#8220;There are certain well-known
facts that compel me to believe you are wrong
in your estimate of the time already elapsed
since your incarceration by the flood. You
are, perhaps, aware that in situations such as
ours, the human mind errs outrageously in its
calculations of time. Persons buried alive for
a few hours invariably deem the time many
days. One lives through great suffering; he
believes that the time of his agony has been
correspondingly great, though it may have
been a matter of seconds, rather than of hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
This involuntary exaggeration seems a universal
rule. We can&#8217;t reasonably believe that
we are constituted differently from other men.
With the judgment clarified by reason, based
on knowledge of allied facts, I am compelled
to believe&mdash;in direct contradiction to my own
feelings, as well as yours&mdash;that the time
elapsed since the lake broke in on us hasn&#8217;t
been more than&mdash;&#8221; Billy paused to reflect,
running over the sequence of events, as the
basis of computation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how long is it&mdash;measured by logic,
and not by emotion?&#8221; Saxe demanded, somewhat
sulkily.</p>

<p>&#8220;And, after all,&#8221; Billy remarked musingly,
&#8220;time is only one of the categories of human
thought, as Kant pointed out. To me, it seems
eons since I was in the great out-of-doors&mdash;free,
free to live. I judge by reasoning that
we have been shut up here for nearly an
hour&mdash;not quite.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Roy could voice the protest on his
lips, a cry came from Saxe:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hark! Hark!&#8221;</p>

<p>The others held silent, marveling what this
might mean. To their ears came the gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
lapping of the waves against the walls of the
prison-house, the faint sighs of their own
breathing&mdash;nothing else. After a long time,
Saxe spoke again; and his voice was lifeless,
where before it had been vibrant with feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must be going mad,&#8221; he said, simply. &#8220;I
thought that I heard&mdash;someone&mdash;calling my
name.&#8221;</p>

<small>TO THE CHIMNEY</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2">AS THEY were lingering over the breakfast
table, that same morning, Margaret
turned to May with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think of them, off adventuring now,
this very minute!&#8221; she exclaimed, pouting a
little. &#8220;It was rather horrid of them to go at
such an unearthly hour, when of course we
weren&#8217;t up.&#8221;</p>

<p>May nodded cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;d have enjoyed being in at the
finish&mdash;if only I&#8217;d been invited.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I, too,&#8221; Margaret declared. &#8220;Anyhow,
it&#8217;s my affair in a way, so I think I&#8217;m entitled
to a spectator&#8217;s privilege, at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be horribly exciting for you, with
so much money involved,&#8221; May ventured,
somewhat timidly.</p>

<p>Margaret received the suggestion without
sign of offense, and answered seriously:</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish Mr. Temple to fail. I don&#8217;t
really need the money. Besides&mdash;&#8221; she broke
off in confusion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>&#8220;And, besides, everything may come out
right, after all, for everybody concerned,&#8221; May
said slily.</p>

<p>Margaret blushed to warmest rose, but she
showed no displeasure at the innuendo.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except the poor musicians,&#8221; she remarked;
and then the two girls laughed joyously. As
a matter of fact, each of them understood perfectly
the progress of the other&#8217;s love-affair,
but their intimacy was too new for the most
sacred confidences. Then, Margaret received
an inspiration:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ll go,&#8221; she exclaimed. Her expression
showed surprised triumph over the
idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; May questioned, at a loss.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the island, of course,&#8221; came the brisk
answer. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run and tell mother, and then
we&#8217;ll paddle up there, and see everything that&#8217;s
to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; May cried with enthusiasm.
She was interested in the outcome of the
treasure-hunt, but at this moment her sole
thought was a thrilling one to the effect that
by the plan she would see Roy the sooner.</p>

<p>So, it came about that in mid-afternoon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
two girls beached the canoe on the strip of
sand at the island, and started toward the cavern.
They were a little puzzled by the absence
of the launch, and wondered if the fact were
significant of good or ill fortune for the
searchers. As they came to the top of the
low bluff that rose from the shore, Margaret
paused, and turned to look out over the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, the launch isn&#8217;t in sight anywhere,&#8221;
she said.</p>

<p>As she would have faced about to go on,
a faint muffled sound came to her ears; the
ground trembled very slightly; a movement of
the lake&#8217;s surface caught her glance. A moment
before, the tiny waves, glistening prisms
under the sunlight, had made a scene of quiet
beauty. Now, in the twinkling of an eye, there
had come a change&mdash;a change curious, inexplicable,
sinister. Out there in the lake, only
a little way from the shore, the water, which
had been so placid when they skimmed over
it hardly a minute before, was now writhing
in a horrible convulsion. Yet, no unwarned
tempest racked the lake. The warm air was
floating as languidly as hitherto. Nothing had
been hurled into the water. There had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
no crash of fallen meteor. Naught showed
as the cause of this amazing contrast. Nevertheless,
under her eyes, the erstwhile tranquil
bosom of the lake heaved in rage. Fifty yards
from the shore, the water raced, lashing itself
in wrath about the sunken center of its vortex.
Margaret, thrilled, astounded, terrified, caught
May by the arm, pulled her about.</p>

<p>&#8220;See! See!&#8221; she cried, wildly. &#8220;What is
it? What can it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>May, too, was stupefied by the spectacle.
She stared at it in wordless confusion. She
could make no guess as to the cause of this
extraordinary event, nor tried to. She merely
watched the mad carouse of the flood, and
stood aghast. A great fear of this uncanny
thing fell on the two girls, so that they clung
together for protection, shuddering, their faces
pallid.</p>

<p>It seemed to the watchers as if that mysterious
turmoil in the waters of the lake
continued for hours, though, as Billy Walker
might have explained to them, it was doubtless
no more than a matter of minutes. The commotion
spread over a broad area, but the girls
had eyes only for the central place of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
movement, the maelstrom near the shore,
where the waters whirled in funnel shape,
with the swaying hollow pointing the downward
rush. An engineer would have known
at first glance the reason for this churning of
the lake, would have understood that some
sudden vent below had set the tide racing to
new liberty. But the girls had no such learning
in physics. They could only look on in fascinated
wonder, in awe. Haphazard, fantastic
ideas darted in their brains, vague guesses
concerning sea-serpents, earthquakes, tidal
waves, waterspouts, which their own native
sense rejected. Throughout the experience,
neither was able to contrive any explanation
of the extraordinary event. They were as
confounded at the end as at the beginning.</p>

<p>Little by little, the waters of the lake ran
slowly, and more slowly, in the path set them
by the whorl. At last, there was scarcely a
ripple to mark the spot where the cauldron
had seethed hottest. Once again, there was
nothing to see save the light tossing of the
waves, dancing to the rhythm of the breeze
toward the kisses of the sun. Margaret and
May set their faces once more toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
cavern.</p>

<p>They were garrulous over the mystery&mdash;hardly
concerned with the treasure-quest, for
the moment. But the new interest had not
lessened the desire of their hearts, and they
quickened their steps, each at thought of the
man she loved, now so near at hand. So they
came soon to the cliff in the ravine, where
was the entrance to the cave. Margaret had
brought her torch, which Jake had recharged
for her the night before from his own supplies.
She pressed the button, pushed aside the concealing
branches, and made her way within
the opening, followed closely by May, who
experienced a pleasurable excitement as she
thus penetrated into the earth. The two came
duly to the chamber, which they crossed to
where the black openings into the tunnels
showed. Now, May&#8217;s heart beat faster, as she
found herself deep in this grim abode of darkness,
where the limited radiance of the torch
served but to make more grotesquely menacing
the shadowy unknown on every side. Yet, she
would not confess the fear that clutched at
her&mdash;only, held fast to Margaret&#8217;s arm, and
chatted with unusual volubility, while a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
quaver crept in her voice. They entered the
passage on the right, which Margaret had
traversed with Saxe, and went forward with
what speed they might over the rocks that
cumbered the floor. They had descended for
some distance, but had not yet reached the rift
that led across into the other tunnel, when
Margaret halted abruptly, with a gasp of
amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s water!&#8221; she cried, dumfounded.
She stood staring with dilated eyes, her lips
parted, stupefied with astonishment, pointing
with her free hand to the space before her,
where the glow of the torch shone on a softly
rippling level of water, which filled the tunnel
like the contents of a well seen down the slope.</p>

<p>May, who had held her eyes fixed on the
floor to save herself from stumbling, looked
forward at the exclamation, and perceived the
water. But the sight was not especially impressive
to her. She supposed that here was
merely a well in the path. She did not understand
her friend&#8217;s dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked, with no great
interest. She wondered in which direction
they would turn to pass by the pool.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>Margaret, however, was thinking with desperate
energy. Her mind was naturally keen,
and it had enjoyed advantages of careful
training. She began, at last, to suspect something
as to the true significance of the catastrophe
in the lake, which hitherto had baffled
comprehension. The presence of water in the
cavern, where before had been no water,
stunned her at first; then, as she apprehended
vaguely the meaning of it, it appalled. There
where the tunnel was steep, the water filled it
completely. She went forward until the water
was at her very feet, and stared down at it,
her face colorless, her pulse bounding wildly,
in the grip of cold horror. Finally, she began
stammering affrightedly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The lake&mdash;the water out there&mdash;it&#8217;s broken
into the cavern&mdash;they&#8217;re drowned&mdash;drowned&mdash;Saxe!&#8221;
Her voice rose to a wail on the
last word.</p>

<p>Margaret&#8217;s terror, rather than her words,
had filled the other girl with dismay at the first.
But &#8220;drowned&#8221; gave form to fear. May, in
turn, was stricken with horror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drowned?&#8221; she repeated, in a whisper.
&#8220;Roy?&#8221; Her memory went back to the scene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
she had just witnessed on the lake. The utterance
of Margaret, broken, uncomprehended,
became hideously plain. It meant that the lake
had somehow entered this cavern, which ran
beneath the waters. In that case, the men
down within the earth there must have been
overwhelmed by the in-pouring flood. But,
even as conviction came, her spirit refused
credence to the truth. She cried aloud in
revolt:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! No, I tell you! They are safe&mdash;safe!&#8221;</p>

<p>Margaret gave no heed to the folly of the
words&mdash;the confidence in them spurred her to
endeavor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she exclaimed. She whirled, and
ran swiftly over the rubble, back the way they
had come. Her thoughts were chaotic, but
through them ran refusal to believe the worst.
He&mdash;they&mdash;Saxe must have received warning&mdash;must
be safe, somewhere, somehow&mdash;must
be&mdash;must be! May, hard on Margaret&#8217;s
heels, was sore pressed to keep the pace over
the jumble of fragments.</p>

<p>When they had come to the great chamber,
Margaret, without pause, turned into the passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
on the left. With the same speed, she
hurried along this, panting now. May ran just
behind. Then, finally, the horror, against
which Margaret had hoped, burst full on her.
She halted, reeling, a shriek of despair wavering
on her palsied lips. A few feet away, down
the tunnel&#8217;s slope, lay the level black of water,
shining gently under the beams of the torch,
serene, implacable. May, too, saw and understood,
and rested frozen in dumb anguish over
this ending of all things.</p>

<p>There are certain calamities so unexpected,
so monstrous, that the mind refuses to accept
them as fact at first announcement, no matter
what the proof. It was so here. The two
girls&mdash;freshly stirring to the most subtle and
the most potent of human emotions, love, come
forth in the morning with gladness of heart to
meet the men of their choice, gaily eager to
learn of an adventure&mdash;were now, in a flash,
confronted with an inconceivable disaster.
They would not accept the fact&mdash;they could
not. There was, there must be, some hideous
mistake, soon to be cleared away. Despite all
evidence, those they loved had not been done
to death, down there within the abysses of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
earth. Somewhere, somehow, they had escaped.
They would come forth presently, and
then there would be only laughter, where now
was terror.</p>

<p>It was this refusal to believe that gave
Margaret inspiration to action at last. Of a
sudden, she bethought herself of that other
entrance to the cavern, concerning which she
had spoken to Saxe. On the instant, she again
turned, and fled back through the tunnel without
a word. May, not understanding, yet still
defiant of fate, followed. The time was marvelously
short until they were again in the
ravine outside the cavern. But Margaret did
not pause here&mdash;she did not even trouble to
cut off the current of her torch, of which the
glow showed wanly against the sunlight, as
she went running swiftly through the ravine,
and out on the little plateau that lay at its
mouth. There, she hesitated, but only for a
second, her eyes sweeping the undulations of
the island while memory struggled for assurance.
Certainty flashed on her, and again she
leaped forward, May always close beside in
the flight. Across the plateau Margaret sped,
into a gully that ran toward the shore, up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
stiff slope to the crest of a ridge, which was
part of the bluff overlooking the lake. The
summit was boulder-strewn, a medley of
masses lying topsy-turvy. She threaded a
way among the rocks, perforce more slowly,
yet still with feverish haste. At last, she
halted, with a great cry of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is here!&#8221; she said softly. There was a
note of reverent thankfulness in her voice.</p>

<p>May looked, wondering, and saw a small
hole amid the rocks at her feet. It was less
than a yard in length, and in breadth much
narrower. She perceived that it was not quite
vertical, though almost. A short way below
the surface, its course was hidden in blackness.</p>

<p>Margaret wasted not a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in there, I know,&#8221; she explained,
succinctly, to May. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to show them
the way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the girl knew nothing
as to the fact she stated so authoritatively.
She had no least idea as to that part of the
cavern on which the chimney gave. Her cousin
had pointed it out, and had told her that by it
he first made his way within. Beyond that,
she knew nothing whatever. Hope dictated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
her claim to knowledge. She still denied any
credence to the final catastrophe. Here, now,
lay the sole avenue of escape. So she announced
it with positiveness that admitted no
question. Thus only might courage be held.
May, for her part, eager to believe, received
the declaration without doubt. Moreover, Roy
had discoursed to her at length concerning the
curious operations of the sixth sense. With
that receptivity characteristic of the fond
woman, she had accepted his pronouncements
without hesitation, glad to believe whatsoever
he believed. Besides, she had great faith in
feminine intuition&mdash;and what was intuition, if
not that self-same psychic thing over which
her lover rhapsodized? Now, instinct cried
that the man she loved was safe, and she
believed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall I go, too?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Margaret shook her head. She turned to
scan the lake.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you couldn&#8217;t help&mdash;and it
may be bad climbing. But I&#8217;m used to that.
You keep watch for Jake and the launch. He
may be needed later on.&#8221; With that as the last
word, she let herself down into the chimney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
of the rocks. May from above gazed with
wide eyes until the form of her friend disappeared
into the blackness below. Then, she
turned to look out over the lake, in anxious
search for the coming of the launch. Standing
alone there, with the dreadful mystery hidden
within the earth under her feet, she felt a quick
reaction of doubt, which welled swiftly to the
torture of despair. The strength flowed from
her. She sank to her knees, and stared down
into the dark of the chasm with dull, unseeing
eyes&mdash;rested motionless in the apathy of
supreme misery.</p>

<small>IN THE DARK</small></h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MARGARET, as she let herself down into
the chimney, held the torch so as to
show her surroundings. She still clung to the
rock above with her right hand, while the left
was occupied by the torch. As yet, she had
found no footing. The light revealed that this
opening through the ridge was the result of
the lodging of one huge block of stone, which
had left the angle between it and the other
rock empty. A clutter of fragments formed
the third side of a triangle, which extended
downward steeply as far as she could see. A
feeling of sick apprehension swept over her
when she perceived the manner in which some
of the stones hung, seemingly poised to a fall.
Then, in the next instant, she recalled the reason
of her presence there, and conquered dread
in the need of action.</p>

<p>She saw a jutting bit of rock a few inches
below her feet. She let herself down to the
extreme limit of reach, and found herself just
able to touch the support with a toe. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
released her hand-hold, and thus remained,
half-standing, half-lying in the hole. She
searched out other points to which her fingers
might cling, at the height of her breast.
Clenching these, she bent her knees, and finally
came to a crouching posture on the tiny ledge
that had been under her feet. In the like
tedious, slow fashion, she continued the descent,
for a distance of perhaps twenty feet,
without mishap, though in constant danger
of a fall. But, at this point, new difficulties
threatened. Though she took long to search,
she could find nothing to afford a foothold,
even the tiniest. To make the matter worse,
just here the smoothness of the walls was such
that her hands could secure only a doubtful
grip. She studied the situation painstakingly
by means of the torch, making sure that nowhere
a projection of the stone escaped her
observation. She was distraught by this ill
fortune, which threatened the ruin of her
hopes. Finally, however, she perceived by the
light of the torch that, two yards or more
below the point to which her feet reached, the
chimney bent a little, toward the horizontal.
At the sight, Margaret&#8217;s courage sprang to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
new life. Without a second of delay in which
fear might grow, she loosed her hold, and let
herself slip downward.</p>

<p>The steepness of the chimney was so great
that her movement was rather a fall than a
slide. In the very second of the start, she felt
the violent impact of her feet against the stone
as they struck the bend. Nor was the change
of direction sufficient to overcome the impetus
of the drop, as she had hoped. Her body shot
onward down the rough slope. She caught at
the walls with her fingers, but, though the
ragged surface tore the skin from her flesh,
she could get no clutch strong enough to stay
the flight. The torch had slipped from her
grasp without her even being aware of its loss
at the time. In the darkness, she went hurtling
on. Her spirit broke in those seconds of
dreadfulness. She felt that death waited at
the end of the fall. Saxe&#8217;s name was on her
lips when she crashed into pause.</p>

<p>For a long time she lay without any movement,
her sole consciousness a dazed suffering
from bruised flesh and aching bones. Her
senses all but failed, yet did not quite. A
vague, incoherent necessity beat upon her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
brain, though she could by no means understand
what that need might be. Her one
clear realization was of pain&mdash;pain pervasive,
deadly. But, little by little, the torment of
racked nerves lessened. It seemed to her ages
after that hideous drop through the black
when, at last, her mind grew active again. On
the instant, she was a creature transformed.
She contrived with infinite pains to sit erect,
alert to know the truth as to her own condition&mdash;for
she still had work to do. To her
relief, she found that, despite the complaining
of her beaten body, she had been spared broken
bones or other hurt that might disable. There
was misery in each movement, but she could
move, and with that she was content, grateful
to providence that her plight was no worse.
She looked back, and saw, a long way off, a
feeble, pallid light, which came, she made certain,
from the foot of the shaft at the bend.
Now, from its remoteness, she was able to
make some estimate of the distance through
which she had sped beyond it, and she was
fain to wonder that she should be indeed alive.</p>

<p>It was easy to determine that she was lying
on a shelf of rock, which was almost level.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
She felt about this, and even ventured to crawl
a short way. Then, her groping hand struck
on emptiness, and, shuddering, she drew back
from the invisible void. Nevertheless, weakness
gave ground to desire. She must press
onward, somehow, to the rescue. At once, she
began creeping forward, bearing to the right,
on which side she felt the sheer wall of a cliff.
She judged that, by proceeding thus, she would
be safe from the gulf as far as the ledge might
run. She had gone perhaps twenty yards in
this tortoise manner, when a sudden thought
halted her in anger against the folly of having
neglected the simplest expedient. Saxe&mdash;the
others&mdash;might be about anywhere, and she had
not called to them! Forthwith, she gathered
her strength&mdash;such as was left to her&mdash;and
sent out a cry, a pitiful, passionate cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saxe! Saxe!&#8221;</p>

<p>She listened in breathless suspense ...
there came no answer.</p>

<p>Then, after a time, she called again; and
again there came no answer, yet she refused
to lose hold on faith. She sought comfort in
the thought that she was still too far from him
for her voice to carry. So, she set forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
anew on hands and knees, her fingers groping
over the rock on which she crawled, to make
sure that the way was safe for her passing.
Physical suffering rent her, but an indomitable
spirit spurred the jaded body. By sheer
strength of will, she persisted in that pitiful
progress through minute after minute, until at
last she deemed the distance traversed enough
to warrant a second calling into the dark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Saxe! Saxe!&#8221; sounded the repetition of
her summons. Followed an instant of profoundest
silence, as the last echoes of the shrill
cry died.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, the air was shattered
with clamors. A din of shouts roared in her
ears, multiplied by the reverberations of the
cavern, chaotic, deafening. Out of all the
cacophony, her strained sense caught a tone
that thrilled the heart to rapture. Her voice
rose in a scream&mdash;hysterical, triumphant&mdash;in
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Saxe! Saxe!&#8221; And then a weary murmur:
&#8220;Oh, thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>A little silence fell. It was broken by her
own name, spoken in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>&#8220;Yes, Saxe,&#8221; she answered, simply. It was
evident that the distance between them was
not very great. She wondered that her calling
should have remained unheard in the earlier
effort. It occurred to her that perhaps in the
first attempt she had not really cried out with
all her might&mdash;as was, indeed, the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you, Margaret&mdash;you came for us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; There was no need to explain that
she had come for him, for him alone. Oh, she
would be very glad that the others should win
to life&mdash;but she had come for him, for him
only. &#8220;You are safe?&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; The others were silent, giving the
dialogue to the girl and Saxe, for they understood
how it was between the two. &#8220;You came
by the other entrance, of which you told me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;through the chimney, on the ridge by
the shore. May is there, watching and waiting
for Jake to come. We shall need help to get
out. It is hard to climb. I slipped coming
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are hurt!&#8221; The lover&#8217;s voice was
harsh with fear.</p>

<p>But Margaret laughed blithely. What matter
a few bruises now?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>&#8220;It shook me up a bit,&#8221; she confessed. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m all right. The worst of it was that I lost
my torch. Can you come to me here? I know
how to find the way back in the dark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Billy Walker deemed it time that he should
assume direction of the affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how high above the water
you are there, Miss West?&#8221; he demanded. The
gruff voice was very gentle, for gratitude to
this girl burned hot in him, as in the others.
She had brought the gift of life to dead men.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Margaret answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are on a ledge, of course,&#8221; the sage
continued. &#8220;Please get to the edge of it, and
reach down with your hand, and find if you
can touch the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a little delay before the reply
came.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221; The sharp admonition was
from Saxe.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s almost level with the shelf I&#8217;m on,&#8221; the
girl continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; Billy&#8217;s tone was full of satisfaction.
&#8220;That makes it very simple. We shall
swim across to you, and then you will guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
us from these Plutonian shades back to the
upper world.&#8221; He turned toward the companions
whom he could not see, and addressed
them with crisp authority. &#8220;You will go first,
Saxe. Her voice will guide you&mdash;she&#8217;s directly
across the chamber from us. Be ready afterward
to help us with David when we get there.
We shall allow you ample time to&mdash;er&mdash;climb
out before we start to tote Dave. Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off,&#8221; Saxe answered, promptly. Then,
he called to Margaret, &#8220;Talk a bit, please,
while I&#8217;m in the water, so that I&#8217;ll know the
direction. I&#8217;m just starting.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight splash as Saxe lowered
his body into the water, and the soft swish
from his strokes as he swam away.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, Saxe! Here I am! This way!&#8221; The
girl continued the calls with joy in her tones.
Then, a minute later, she heard him speak her
name softly, at her feet. In another instant,
he was beside her on the ledge&mdash;she was in his
arms, their lips met. He had no thought of
his dripping garments, nor had she. They had
no knowledge of anything save heaven.</p>

<p>Billy Walker&#8217;s voice went thundering across
the cavern:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>&#8220;Are you there, Saxe?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no reply. The sage chuckled
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;The exercise of reason teaches me,&#8221; he
explained in a voluminous whisper, &#8220;that our
dear young friend is not drowned&mdash;oh, no! As
a matter of fact, at this moment, he has already
got clear of the water, and doesn&#8217;t know where
he is, but is happier than he ever was before
in his life. When he awakes from the trance,
he will address us.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, in truth, it came to pass. Presently, the
call came from Saxe, and the progress of the
three across the cavern was safely accomplished.
Arrived, they pressed about the girl,
who was standing, supported by her lover&#8217;s
arm, and mightily embarrassed by the fervor
of their gratitude for the boon of life bestowed
on them by her intrepidity and resource.
Finally, the five set forth along the ledge, following
it as Margaret had come, by groping
on the sheer wall from which it jutted. And,
now, the girl no longer went with painful slowness
on hands and knees, but walked bravely,
upheld by the lover at her side. So, at last,
they came to the spot where Margaret&#8217;s fall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
had ended. To their left, seemingly a great
way off, and high above them, showed the
pallid gleam from the bend of the chimney&mdash;blessed
harbinger of God&#8217;s light above.</p>

<p>Billy Walker surveyed the dim vista of
ascent with extreme disfavor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake must bring ladders,&#8221; he declared.
&#8220;Luckily, he&#8217;s to fetch along help&mdash;a whole
crew for the rescue work. Oh, yes, I&#8217;ll wait&mdash;I
don&#8217;t mind waiting. The water was warm,
and the cavern&#8217;s warm, and, anyhow, wet
clothes don&#8217;t bother&mdash;if one doesn&#8217;t think of
them. But I wish I had a dry cigar and a
match.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy thrust himself forward resolutely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll climb up in
a jiffy.&#8221; He had pulled off his shoes before
starting for the first swim with David across
the chamber, and now stood up in his stockinged
feet. &#8220;I&#8217;m fond of cliff-climbing. The
only trouble with this is, it&#8217;ll prove too easy.&#8221;
Without more ado, he scrambled upward
through the darkness. The others waited anxiously,
and breathed a sigh of relief when they
saw his form at last silhouetted against the
pale light at the bend. His voice came to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
muffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest will be quicker, I can see, now.&#8221;
Forthwith, he vanished.</p>

<p>It was May on the solid earth above who
heard him, and the happiness of it made her
almost fainting. But she held herself sternly,
and even managed a quavering call of his
name&mdash;for which, when he heard, Roy climbed
the faster, and soon these two were in each
other&#8217;s arms, glad beyond measure of gladness.
The girl was in terror over the blood-stained
bandage about her lover&#8217;s head, and cried when
she learned of the treacherous shot that had
wounded him. She cried again, with content,
that it had been no worse. Most of all, she
cried for the exquisite bliss of his being alive
and holding her in his arms&mdash;ruining the
daintiest of summer frocks with his sodden,
rock-stained clothes.</p>

<p>The strangeness of the spectacle thus presented
by the ardent pair arrested the attention
of Jake and his crew, who chanced just then
to arrive in the launch. So great became the
boatman&#8217;s curiosity that he resolved to investigate
before marching his company into the
cavern. To this fact, and not to any alertness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
on the part of the lovers in looking out for the
coming of the launch, was due the quickness
with which measures of relief were undertaken
for those left in the depths. Ropes were hurried
to the scene; a lantern was lowered. It
was then discovered that the descent was not
so very difficult. With the way lighted, and a
rope by which to cling, the various members
of the party contrived to climb safely to the
mouth of the chimney. Margaret went first,
with Saxe behind to aid as best he might.
David Thwing was next, and last of all, by his
own choice, Billy Walker.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I go last,&#8221; he explained to David, &#8220;I&#8217;m
saved the discomfort of feeling that I ought
to be hurrying to get out of somebody&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p>

<p>After the rescue had been effected, a watch
made up from men trusted by the boatman was
set over the chimney, at Roy&#8217;s suggestion.
Then, the four young men, with the two girls,
entered the launch to be taken to the cottage,
for a change of clothing and luncheon. Billy
chuckled contentedly, while the other men appeared
sheepish, when it was learned that noon
remained still an hour distant.</p>

<p>&#8220;But the chances are poor of ever getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
that gold, after all,&#8221; Saxe said ruefully, when
they were under weigh.</p>

<p>Roy uttered an indignant exclamation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing of the sort!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;David
and I had the tackle fastened, all right, with
a knot on the rope to save it from slipping
through the block. And we had it hauled
tight, too.&#8221; He laughed amusedly. &#8220;Why, do
you know? That treasure-chest has started up
the slope already! I&#8217;ll bet what you like the
shrinking of the rope has brought it out of the
pit. A good gang of men can get that chest
out in less than a half-day.&#8221; He spoke with
the sureness of one having knowledge drawn
from experience. That he was right the issue
proved, for the gold was taken out very easily,
and stored safely in the bank before nightfall.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That evening in the music-room, Saxe sat
playing the miser&#8217;s song of gold. Still drumming
the harsh phrases, he turned, and spoke
to his friends with a whimsical smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I rather apologized to you for
asking your help in this affair, because it didn&#8217;t
offer anything much in the way of real adventure,
but it did turn out a bit lively after all!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>Came a chorus of laughing assents.</p>

<p>&#8220;We owe Masters gratitude for some
thrills,&#8221; David said cheerfully. &#8220;And anyhow,
he&#8217;s got his deserts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roy was on the point of saying something
candid anent the dead engineer. But his eyes
met those of May Thurston, and he forgot
hate, and remembered only love.</p>

<p>Saxe spoke again presently, with a meditative
air, though Margaret thought that she
could detect a twinkle deep in the gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Roy was right in his idea about the solution
of the mystery coming by psychic impression.
It did. The curious part is that the one to
receive the subtle suggestion from the world
beyond was the last person to be suspected of
anything of the kind&mdash;a kind so contrary to
pure reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Billy Walker demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, about the cipher,&#8221; Saxe explained,
placidly. &#8220;Billy, tell us the truth. Search
your memory well. Didn&#8217;t you first have the
idea that the music had something to do with
the hiding-place of the gold, and then didn&#8217;t
you dig out the reasons to justify that idea&mdash;after
you had it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>&#8220;Of all the preposterous&mdash;&#8221; the sage began
stormily.</p>

<p>But Saxe interrupted ruthlessly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Carefully! Search your memory, Billy.
Didn&#8217;t the idea come first, the reasons afterward?
Aren&#8217;t you psychically sensitive, Billy
Walker? Confess!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Psychic&mdash;I!&#8221; the seer boomed, outraged.
Then, his brow became furrowed with thought.
His expression changed to one of dismay.
Little by little, this wore away, a dawning
satisfaction grew in its stead. Finally, he
spoke aloud to himself, unconsciously. &#8220;Psychic&mdash;I?
Well, well!&#8221; And Billy Walker
smiled.</p>

<p>Saxe smiled in answer to the smile that was
in Margaret&#8217;s eyes as her glance met his. Then
he turned once again to the piano. The rhythm
of the miser&#8217;s song of gold rang out. But now,
the player touched the harsh measures with a
certain grateful gentleness. In and over and
about the grim chords, he wove daintier harmonies,
lingered often for cadences of passion,
wrought a counterpoint of basic love, set above
all an exquisite melody, the unison of two
hearts. The improvisation welled to a chorale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
of magnificent praise for that lonely and unhappy
man to whose morbid intrigue the player
owed not merely a fortune, but something
infinitely more&mdash;the meeting and the winning
of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only tune I ever cared for,&#8221; quoth
Billy Walker, complacently.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
